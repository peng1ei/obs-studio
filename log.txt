    libobs/util: ARM atomic fixes
    
    Use native instructions on ARM64 (dmb is slow).
    
    Use magic number for 32-bit ARM since _ARM64_BARRIER_ISH is for ARM64.

    libobs/util: Various atomic improvements
    
    Add exchange functions to alias the poorly named set functions.
    
    Add store without reading previous. Faster on non-x86 processors.
    
    Add compare-exchange that updates previous to avoid redundant fetch.
    
    On Windows, load bool without conversion from char.
    
    On Windows, load using mov with compiler barrier. Still seq_cst.
    
    On POSIX, use GCC __atomic builtins.

    libobs: guard against lagging audio sources
    
    df4eb82 fixed a bug that caused source audio timestamps to perpetually
    lag. However, there is a deeper issue where after we reach max
    buffering, lagging sources make OBS's entire audio pipeline fall over.
    These may be corrected by later code, but still cause global audio
    glitches at best. Persistent problems, as prior to df4eb82, cause audio
    to fail entirely.
    
    The root cause is that OBS's audio mixing tree cannot deal with
    timestamps prior to the current audio tick. Intermediate mixing stages
    assume that the lowest incoming timestamp is the base of the current
    tick, and mix accordingly. This propagates lagged timestamps up the
    tree, where at the top level mix_audio will drop the source entirely -
    which at this point is a transition covering all inputs, thus glitching
    audio globally. Where extra buffering can cover the slip, the entire mix
    gets retried and the error corrected, but when the global buffer
    duration is maxed out, it makes it to the output.
    
    The solution is to catch laggy sources immediately after rendering, and
    drop audio to bring them back in sync, or mark them pending if not
    enough audio is available. This ensures later mixing stages are not fed
    with out of sync timestamps.
    
    This improves the ignore_audio code to only drop as much audio as
    needed to bring the source back in sync, and moves its call to
    immediately after source audio rendering.

    obs-outputs: Fix RTMP restart not always working
    
    Bug is caused by the internal connection variables not being reset on
    reconnect, leading OBS to both be unable to parse valid packets from and
    send valid packets to the remote end.  This commit splits RTMP_Init off
    into a new RTMP_Reset function, which resets these internal variables
    without re-initing the rest of the library.  The original RTMP_Init
    calls the new function, perfectly preserving the old behaviour while
    adding a new reset function to address the issue with.
    
    Fixes obsproject/obs-studio#2865

    linux-v4l2: added range check for try_connect()
    
    While the current code only ever calls try_connect() with the input
    argument 'device' in the range of 0 and MAX_DEVICES, this adds a check
    to ensure that future code does not break the following sprintf.
    
    In addition, use snprintf instead of sprintf to ensure that if anything
    breaks, the sprintf does not lead to memory corruption. Again, the new
    check should already make sure of that, but the additional effort of
    using snprintf instead of sprintf is so low that it is worth to have a
    little more security in the future.

    UI: Don't create native widget siblings
    
    Native windows really only make sense for previews. They can be a new
    xcb_window or a wayland subsurface.
    
    For historical reasons setting a widget to native will also affect
    ancestors. Qt will still draw them as part of the parent as they are
    never mapped, but a window is nonetheless created.
    
    This is especially problematic on wayland as then the subsurface is
    parented to an unmapped window.
    
    This default behaviour can be turned off. Now only the native widgets
    (the video previews) are actually native.

    linux-capture: XSelectInput tracking improvement
    
    Track all windows corresponding to sources and ensure that we only
    disable XSelectInput events once all sources for a given window have
    been removed. Previously we may have stopped listening for events if
    multiple sources captured the same window and one was removed.
    
    We also move window redirection into the helper to avoid similar issues.

    linux-capture: Capture windows by id first
    
    Previously we only captured by window name and class. This prevented
    capture of windows with the same name and class, and caused captures to
    switch from one window to another of the same name and class.

    Well, linear SRGB for screen capture. The window capture path failed to
    copy between SRGB textures for some reason, so just force nonlinear

    win-capture: Support linear SRGB
    
    For game capture, neither GL nor D3D9 support SRGB shared textures, so
    disable linear SRGB support if the texture format doesn't support it.
    
    Similarly, DXGI display capture doesn't work with SRGB at the moment.
    Unsure if it will with more work, but disable for now.
    
    Also force linear SRGB off if using GDI-compatible textures.

    libobs: Add dormant SRGB format support
    
    GS_RGBA, GS_BGRX, and GS_BGRA now use TYPELESS DXGI formats, so we can
    alias them between UNORM and UNORM_SRGB as necessary. GS_RGBA_UNORM,
    GS_BGRX_UNORM, and GS_BGRA_UNORM have been added to support straight
    UNORM types, which Windows requires for sharing textures from D3D9 and
    OpenGL. The D3D path aliases via views, and GL aliases via
    GL_EXT_texture_sRGB_decode/GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB.
    
    A significant amount of code has changed in the D3D/GL backends, but the
    concepts are simple. On the D3D side, we need separate SRVs and RTVs to
    support nonlinear/linear reads and writes. On the GL side, we need to
    set the proper GL parameters to emulate the same.
    
    Add gs_enable_framebuffer_srgb/gs_framebuffer_srgb_enabled to set/get
    the framebuffer as SRGB or not.
    
    Add gs_linear_srgb_active/gs_set_linear_srgb to instruct sources that
    they should render as SRGB. Legacy sources can ignore this setting
    without regression.
    
    Update obs_source_draw to use linear SRGB as needed.
    
    Update render_filter_tex to use linear SRGB as needed.
    
    Add gs_effect_set_texture_srgb next to gs_effect_set_texture to set
    texture with SRGB view instead.
    
    Add SRGB helpers for vec4 struct.
    
    Create GDI-compatible textures without SRGB support. Doesn't seem to
    work with SRGB formats.

    linux-v4l2: Add auto reset on timeout option
    
    Adds frame time multiple based timeout option, instead of the hardcoded
    1 second timeout.
    
    Adds optional automatic device stream reset when the device times out.
    Helps with devices that "lock up" or "freeze", for example Magewell and
    Elgato USB HDMI capture devices.
    
    The automatic reset is by default off and optional. Turning it on can
    cause issues for devices that work but drop a lot of frames.

    QLayout->setMargin has been deprecated since Qt 5.13 (though marked
    obsolete since at least Qt 4.8) and removed in Qt6. It was replaced by
    QLayout->setContentsMargins, which is available in all versions of Qt5.
    Building against Qt 5.13+ can produce compiler warnings when using
    QLayout->setMargin, and warnings are bad.

    libobs: Add os_is_obs_plugin function
    
    This function determines if something is an OBS plugin before attempting
    to load it. On Windows, many plugins ship their dependent DLLs alongside
    the plugin DLL, so OBS would load things like libcef.dll on startup only
    to immediately free it. For other platforms, this is less of a concern
    so this function is a no-op for now.
    
    This improves startup time and reduces risk from dependent DLLs
    potentially running code with unwanted side effects in DllMain.

    ftl-stream: Fix reconnect loop on FTL ingest disconnect
    
    When connection to FTL ingest is lost, ftl_event() calls
    obs_output_signal_stop() to trigger a reconnect. However, during the
    reconnect delay, send_thread is still waiting on send_sem semaphore.
    After the delay, ftl_stream_start() is called, which in turn resets
    the semaphore and creates a new send_thread. Old send_thread now exits
    the loop and triggers another reconnect and the whole process repeats
    again. The fix resets the semaphore in ftl_event() so the old
    send_thread exits immediately.

    win-capture: Typeless game capture textures
    
    Modify game capture shared textures to be typeless if they could
    potentially need SRGB and non-SRGB views in the future.
    
    These capture APIs have been updated: D3D 10/11/12, Vulkan.
    
    D3D8 capture does not use shared textures.
    
    D3D9 and GL interop do not support typeless textures.
    
    The new game capture DLL should be compatible with old versions of OBS.
    
    Also removed a lot of dead code around pointless SRV/RTV support.

    linux-jack: fix deadlock when closing the client
    
    This lock causes a deadlock when freeing the JACK client while a
    process callback is pending:
    
    deactivate_jack -> locks mutex
       JACK thread -> calls jack_process_callback
       jack_process_callback -> blocks on mutex
    jack_client_close -> joins JACK thread
    (deadlock as the process callback never returns)
    
    Instead, just don't lock the mutex. This is only mutexing on
    creation/destruction of the JACK client. This is not necessary: the
    process callback will only run after jack_activate (which is right
    before the mutex is released in jack_init()), and will stop running
    by the time jack_client_close returns. We don't actually need to
    unregister any ports, so just call jack_client_close first thing in
    deactivate_jack, which will guarantee the process callback has
    completed before returning.
    
    In fact, jack_process_callback isn't allowed to lock any mutexes or
    allocate any memory at all, so this plug-in is still broken in this way
    as obs_source_output_audio does that. This can cause audio xruns, as
    realtime guarantees are violated. This is something that should be
    fixed in the future, but at least it's not a deadlock.

    libobs: Update to SIMDe 0.7.1
    
    https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/commit/c3d7abfaba6729a8b11d09a314b34a4db628911d
    
    Simplify usage of the SIMDe header
    
    This obviates the need for sse2neon as well and fixes compilation of all
    plugins that referenced sse-intrin.h on all architectures, not just
    arm*.

    Revert "UI: Only apply new scaling behavior on newer installs"
    
    This reverts commit 4e5f20dcbe1506802d9990886aed375cbb75a5b8.
    
    This originally was added because of a faulty assumption that it would
    change defaults, but defaults were apparently broken from 26.0.2 -> 26.1
    because primaryScreen->size() changed its behavior, so the original code
    technically fixed the original behavior.

    UI: Only apply new scaling behavior on newer installs
    
    The new scaling behavior affects defaults, so only apply it to new
    installs of 26.2 or greater, while maintaining the previous behavior if
    the user is upgrading from an older version.

    UI: Support fractional scaling for Canvas/Base size
    
    Without this change, new profiles created on systems using a fractional
    scaling factor (e.g., 125%, 150%, 175%) will get an incorrect (X, Y)
    pair for the new canvas size. For a display with 125% scaling, OBS would
    set (1536, 864) instead of (1920, 1080). With this change, it will set
    (1920, 1080).

    Request / response latency dominates the download time of small

    4 doesn't consume many more resources and basically doubles the
    download speed, especially on higher latency connections.

    On a modern Windows OS, you can rename an in-use file despite not being

    commit renames in-use files, allowing the new version to be installed.
    Upon a reboot, the previously in-use file will be deleted.

    With the queued connection in d68484e7, the "Deselect" signal for

    queuing of only the context bar update instead of the whole signal
    handler.

    linux-jack: fix timestamp calculation
    
    The previous calculation was completely broken, returning offset
    timestamps in the best case, and complete insanity in the worst case
    (e.g. if an xrun occurs or JACK otherwise has a glitch).

    linux-jack: fix deadlock when closing the client
    
    This lock causes a deadlock when freeing the JACK client while a
    process callback is pending:
    
    deactivate_jack -> locks mutex
       JACK thread -> calls jack_process_callback
       jack_process_callback -> blocks on mutex
    jack_client_close -> joins JACK thread
    (deadlock as the process callback never returns)
    
    Instead, just don't lock the mutex. This is only mutexing on
    creation/destruction of the JACK client. This is not necessary: the
    process callback will only run after jack_activate (which is right
    before the mutex is released in jack_init()), and will stop running
    by the time jack_client_close returns. We don't actually need to
    unregister any ports, so just call jack_client_close first thing in
    deactivate_jack, which will guarantee the process callback has
    completed before returning.
    
    In fact, jack_process_callback isn't allowed to lock any mutexes or
    allocate any memory at all, so this plug-in is still broken in this way
    as obs_source_output_audio does that. This can cause audio xruns, as
    realtime guarantees are violated. This is something that should be
    fixed in the future, but at least it's not a deadlock.

    linux-pulseaudio: fix race conditions
    
    PulseAudio code needs to be called with the PA lock held. This chiefly
    fixes multiple races during stream shutdown:
    
    * If the functions are called without the lock held, deferred event
      handling races end up with PA infinite looping on the mainloop, or
      asserting, or other badness, as the reentrant calls cause data
      structure corruption on the PA side.
    * If we don't reset our callbacks, PA might call us even after we
      request stream disconnection (since the stream actually getting fully
      shut down is asynchronous), and then we dereference NULL pointers from
      our userdata etc. PA will keep its data structures alive until necessary
      via reference counting, but not ours.
    
    The lock around pa_stream_begin_write doesn't result from any issues I
    experienced, but it looks correct; PA doesn't say anywhere that that
    function is thread-safe.

    If the user hasn't specifically set a rate control and left OBS at the
    default of CBR, the settings loaded by GetDataFromJsonFile will not have
    a rate_control parameter present. This causes the replay buffer to think
    the user is in VBR mode and use the wrong settings for determining
    maximum buffer size. Fixes #2516.

    linux-v4l2: Fix bashism in v4l2loopback module detection
    
    When /bin/sh isn't bash, the previous line always appears to succeed,
    and modinfo's output is not redirected, because it actually runs
    modinfo in the background (which always succeeds) then opens and closes
    /dev/null without doing anything to it. This causes us to always think
    that the v4l2loopback module is installed, even when it isn't.

    UI: Fix vod track not working with twitch soundtrack
    
    The vod track in advanced output mode would be overwritten by twitch
    soundtrack's vod track. Additionally, simple output mode would overwrite
    twitch's soundtrack vod track even when vod track was turned off in
    settings.
    
    So instead, if vod track is off, don't clear the secondary encoder
    unless it's explicitly our encoder. Additionally, make sure that
    advanced output mode's vod track encoder behaves consistently with
    simple output mode's vod track so it doesn't get overwritten.

    UI: Prevent name collision during scene collection import
    
    The Scene Collection Importer would attempt to set the new filename
    using the name property of the scene collection. However, it would
    determine an unused filename, and then replace spaces with underscores,
    which could cause a name collision. This changes the importer to replace
    spaces with underscores first for the base filename, and then determine
    an unused filename.

    UI: Various screen reader fixes
    
    This commit fixes various issues with screen readers in the main OBS
    interface. These were tested using NVDA on Windows 10 2004.
    
    Audio track selection in Settings now says Track 1, 2, etc, rather than
    just the number.
    
    Various checkboxes that just say "Enable" now have accessible text that
    says what the enable is for (since it says "checkbox", the fact it's an
    enable should hopefully be clear).
    
    Type in the recording tab of output now has accessible text which says
    "Recording Type".
    
    Items in the Advanced Audio Properties window now have accessible text
    for what they are for. Currently some do not report correct values, but
    that will require an accessible interface in Qt to be written
    specifically for that, which will be done at a later date.
    
    Buttons in the filters window now have accessible text for what they do.
    
    All the right side buttons in hotkeys now have tooltips, and by
    extension, accessible text.

    UI: Force plugins to use our Qt5Network, not their own
    
    The Elgato Streamdeck plugin ships their own Qt5Network.dll on Windows,
    which may be ABI incompatible with newer Qt DLLs if we decide to update
    our Qt version. So to prevent that plugins (and other plugins) from
    using their Qt5Network.dll, we need to explicitly load our
    Qt5Network.dll first so that we can prevent it from trying to load
    theirs beforehand.
    
    For context on this, previously, we didn't ship Qt5Network on Windows
    because we would have to ship OpenSSL with it, but we didn't want to
    ship it without SSL support. Because of that, Elgato's Streamdeck plugin
    would ship their own Qt5Network.dll library (that didn't have SSL
    support anyway). However, Qt recently added support for windows
    schannel, which allows SSL support via the Windows API, making it so we
    don't have to ship extra libraries to get SSL. So now we can start
    shipping Qt5Network without worry.

    obs-ffmpeg: Add error detection to ffmpeg-mux network streams
    
    ffmpeg-mux does not notice if ffmpeg returns an error from
    av_interleaved_write_frame() which means that OBS never knows if there
    is a problem in ffmpeg.
    
    This is the biggest issue for cases like srt:// or tcp:// streams that
    can regularly fail. Without this change OBS never knows that something
    went wrong.
    
    Only network streams are checked to prevent impacting potential
    transient errors in recordings.

    deps/media-playback: Fix audio segment duration calc
    
    With certain audio encoders, gaps can be introduced into the audio
    packets, causing the audio duration to be miscalculated because it
    calculated audio duration based upon the PTS of the current packet to
    the last packet. However, this audio encoder also did not store
    timestamps for most of its audio packets, causing PTS values to be
    calculated based upon duration values. So those two things combined
    caused audio timestamps to go all out of whack when playing back certain
    videos with the media source. This is particularly prevalent with WMV
    files using Microsoft codecs.
    
    So to fix it, when the duration needs to be calculated, just calculate
    the duration based upon the sample count of the audio packet. This fixes
    the issue with the video in question that caused problems, and likely
    fixes issues in a lot of videos that may have been floating out there
    for some time. Basically this is a fix for a potential long-standing
    issue.
    
    Closes obsproject/obs-studio#3683

    UI: Detect other instances of obs on FreeBSD
    
    Detect other instances of the obs by creating an extra dummy thread,
    named "OBS runonce". The process of threads enumeration of current user
    is guarded by an O_EXLOCK file advisory lock when opening the lock file.
    Such file lock would be dropped once the thread name is changed.
    
    This should be usable on FreeBSD and possibly compile on DragonFly BSD.

    UI: Add service res/fps limitation support to settings
    
    Allows services to limit and enforce resolution and framerate values the
    user can select in the UI if "ignore service recommendations" is not
    checked. If the "ignore service recommendations" option is not checked,
    the user will not be able to select or use a resolution and/or framerate
    in the user interface that the service does not support. If "ignore
    service recommendations" is checked, it will work as it normally would,
    allowing any value to be used as per normal.
    
    Fortunately, and hopefully for the foreseeable future, there is only one
    service that enforces resolutions and framerates.

    libobs: Add desktop session type to Linux log
    
    Add the content of the XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable to
    the output log if it is set. This is usually set on modern Linux
    distributions and typically carry either "x11" or "wayland" when
    run from a desktop environment.
    
    This is independent from the QT_QPA_PLATFORM environment variable
    which would allow OBS Studio to run inside a wayland session. The
    session type it runs on does have an implication on the behavior of
    some plugins like screen and window capture. So having this
    information exposed here is extremely helpful for diagnosing
    issues.

    obs-ffmpeg/ffmpeg-mux: Fix issue with HLS
    
    For some reason, currently unknown, FFmpeg logging has to be set to
    something in order for HLS to not fail on Windows, even if it's just an
    empty function.
    
    (Author comment: I don't feel comfortable not knowing why, my theory is
    that FFmpeg has an issue with this internally with HLS on Windows
    related to logging or how it's trying to log, I have absolutely no idea
    what's going on and if someone can enlighten me or debug FFmpeg itself
    it'd be real nice to know why.)

    win-dshow: Fix decoupled audio with EVGA/magewell
    
    EVGA/magewell devices seem to use the default system drivers rather than
    custom drivers, which causes their audio to become decoupled and treated
    as completely separate devices rather than as an audio pin on the video
    device. Basically, this would cause those devices to not have audio by
    default, and force the user to have to manually select the audio, which
    is bad user experience.
    
    We already had a workaround for this with elgato devices, so expand that
    code to become a whitelist of devices, and include EVGA/magewell
    devices.

    libobs-winrt: Use native cursor draw for WGC
    
    We were performing a custom cursor draw for WGC, which we attempted
    because we thought we could bring back hardware cursor responsiveness,
    but MS says that it won't. Since the custom draw was bugged to cause
    black screens anyway, just use the native cursor draw for now.

    win-capture: Violate Vulkan spec for compatibility
    
    Rivatuner Statistics Server calls vkGetInstanceProcAddr for
    vkCreateDevice with a NULL instance. According to spec, this should
    return NULL, but RTSS will dereference this and crash.
    
    This change returns function pointers for every intercepted function
    regardless of instance, which is enough to keep RTSS alive.

    obs-ffmpeg: Add error detection to ffmpeg-mux
    
    ffmpeg-mux does not notice if ffmpeg returns an error from
    av_interleaved_write_frame() which means that OBS never knows if there is a
    problem in ffmpeg.
    
    This is the biggest issue for cases like srt:// or tcp:// streams that can
    regularly fail. Without this change OBS never knows that something went wrong.

    UI: Greatly improve main window repaint performance
    
    The VolumeMeter widgets were apparently being drawn as transparent
    widgets, which meant that it was necessary to redraw everything under
    the widgets in order to properly draw the widgets, so the entire mixer
    section of the window was being redrawn every time the meters updated.
    This caused a significant perf hit when the only thing wanted/desired
    was just to update the meters. This was more noticeable after changing
    the audio meter update rate to 60hz from 30hz.
    
    The fix is to simply mark them as opaque widgets, and paint the
    background ourselves rather than rely on what's under the window. CPU
    perf for painting the main window has been vastly improved because of
    this; CPU usage of Qt in the main window is now reduced by at least half
    of what it was, if not more.

    UI: Fix screenshots preventing auto-remux
    
    Due to the fact that a global was used on GenerateSpecifiedFilename to
    save the remux file name, when a screenshot was made, it would overwrite
    the filename being remuxed, because screenshots use the same function to
    generate filenames as well.
    
    This solves that problem by removing the global and the changes to
    GeneratedSpecifiedFilename, and isolating that to the output handler.
    
    Coincidentally, this bug probably also happened with replay buffers
    under certain circumstances.

    UI: Do not always have log viewer loaded
    
    This object should not always be created on startup. Instead, only load
    it specifically when the user wants to load it.
    
    This fixes a freeze some users were experiencing due to the text widget.
    Unfortunately, it is not yet known how that freeze occurred with the log
    viewer, so for the time being do not load the log viewer object unless
    explicitly created.

    UI: Replace/simplify device toolbar
    
    The old version of the device toolbar was a complex situation.  Because
    of the fact that device properties can take significant time to query,
    this put an unpleasant burden on the UI thread; so to fix this problem,
    the device toolbar was made to be threaded.  However, threading is a
    complex and dangerous thing, and there is a fear that this could cause
    complications down the line whenever users are simply selecting devices.
    
    So for the time being, as a safety precaution, simplify the device
    toolbar down to just the "activate" button, and make it so that if users
    really need to query and change the devices, that they need to
    explicitly open the properties.  That way the devices aren't being
    queried constantly every time a device source is selected.
    
    Alternatively in the future, device enumeration could be cached, but
    seeing as that's a significant amount of work and needs to take in to
    account whether a user adds/removes a device while the process is
    active, that's not going to happen any time soon.

    win-dshow: Add VirtualCam installer scripts
    
    This adds two batch scripts to install and uninstall the virtual cam
    devices for installations where the installer could not be used.  Most
    commonly, this is for portable installations or those who prefer the
    .zip file.

    Allows the ability to install extra data from a specific absolute path
    rather than a path relative to the cmake current source dir.  Useful if
    say I want to generate data files in to the cmake binary folder rather
    than put them in the data folder of the cmake source dir.

    UI: Change the default color setting in the UI from sRGB to 709
    
    It seems like YouTube applies nonlinear-to-linear sRGB, and
    linear-to nonlinear-709 transformations to uploaded videos now. This
    makes sRGB too dark on their platform for video players that alias 709
    as sRGB, which is almost everyone. Make 709 the default to keep peace.

    UI: Make SetupOutputs virtual instead of ignoring vcam
    
    In 218b936b1dae, the virtual camera was ignored when checking the active
    state, which is kind of a lackluster solution.  Instead, this makes
    SetupOutputs() a virtual function, and calls it before starting the
    virtual camera to be more consistent with the rest of the outputs.

    win-capture: Put window capture update data in a mutex
    
    Because the window capture source updates its data whenever certain
    properties are modified, this would cause a race condition because
    source updates normally happen in the graphics thread.  To solve this
    for the time being, put access to that data within a mutex when updating
    or updating visibility.

    UI: Fix auto-remux not working w/ slash filesnames
    
    When the feature was added to allow slashes in recording/replay
    filenames to automatically create directories, auto-remux was not
    accounted for, and all filenames were assumed to be complete.  It used
    fi.completeBaseName() to construct the new name which would only add the
    last part after the last slash as the filename, causing the remuxed file
    to save in the base directory rather than the intended directory.  This
    fixes that by simply using the input string as the output string,
    removing the extension, appending the new extension.

    UI: Do not show tray icon if not active
    
    Because the virtual camera stops immediately when you call
    obs_output_stop() rather than with a delay like other outputs, it
    exposed a bug where the tray icon would show OBS as active when stopping
    the source, regardless of the fact that it was stopped.  The bug was
    that the expression used to activate the tray icon did not check to make
    sure that the output was actually active, so add that to the expression.

    UI: Fix crash when starting vcam before other outputs
    
    The BasicOutputHandler::Active() function was used for checking whether
    outputs had started or not.  However, the virtual camera is not used in
    the subclasses; instead it's a part of the base class.  Because of that
    fact, when the virtual camera is started, the procedures used to start
    up the other outputs are never called, causing outputs to crash because
    they hadn't been initialized properly.  For example, starting the
    virtual camera, then starting stream/recording would crash.
    
    So, as a simple fix to this, when checking the active status in the
    derived classes, do not factor in the virtual camera.

    UI: Disable scene rename shortcut key while renaming
    
    While editing a scene name, the Qt shortcut key for the renameScene
    action remained active. If the user pressed the shortcut key while
    actively editing a scene name, the widget would retrigger the action,
    causing the name edit to fail and discard the current changes to the
    scene name. The scene name would be reset to its previous saved value
    and reselected as if the user had pressed the shortcut key for the first
    time.
    
    This commit removes the QAction associated with the shortcut key from
    the scenes dock widget when editing starts and adds the action back to
    the widget once editing is done.
    
    Fixes #3044.

    rtmp-services/rtmp-custom: Apply repeat_headers video setting to srt output
    
    If the video encoder allows video headers repetition at IDR frames,
    and if the output is not rtmp (so srt, udp, etc with mpegts container),
    this commit enables application of this setting from the custom service
    (since srt is available through that service).

    obs-ffmpeg: Allow video headers repetition in IDR and bitstream for jim-nvenc
    
    This commit adds a repeat_headers setting which will allow sps/pps
    repetition and AUDs(access unit delimiters) .
    Repetition is ensured by h264config->repeatSPSPPS &
    h264config->disableSPSPPS;
    the two parameters are set by nvenc to true on default.
    When video headers repetition is required, we set the second in
    jim-nvenc to false so that SPS/PPS are written into bitstream.
    The first parameter could be omitted but is exposed since repetition of
    video headers might not be required.
    When headers repetition is enabled, we also enable AUD to facilitate
    decoding.
    Typically the video headers repetition will be useful for mpegts and
    DVB broadcast decoders.

    obs-x264: Allow repeat_headers and annexb parameters to be set
    
    The repeat_headers parameter is currently hard-coded to false and can
    not be changed.
    For mpegts container and allow better compatibility with broadcast
    mpegts decoders, it is mandatory to repeat the sps/pps headers
    regularly.
    This commit enables this parameter to be set either by the user or the
    service (ex: udp or srt w/ mpegts container).
    The b_annexb enables compatibility with Annex B bitstream which is
    better for streaming formats than avcc.

    In a discussion on Discord the consensus was that 48 kHz is a better
    default. This was prompted by the merge of the rnnoise library which can
    only handle 48 kHz natively. 48 kHz is also more commonly used as a
    default on personal computers.

    obs-filters: Add option to use RNNoise for noise reduction
    
    This commit adds support to using Xiph and Mozilla RNNoise library for
    noise reduction.
    
    RNNoise is a small library using an AI approach to noise reduction
    using a pre-trained model like RTX Voice. But unlike RTX Voice, it is
    very tiny, use CPU instead of GPU and only use little resources.
    Obviously it is not as efficient but will effectively remove background
    noise. It uses more CPU than the existing libspeex-based noise
    reduction but it also sounds sounds way better.
    
    RNNoise support is added to the noise reduction effect. It can be
    enabled with a checkbox in the effect configuration. RNNoise has no
    settings.

    UI: Source Toolbar
    
    The source toolbar allows quick and easy access to properties and
    filers, and shows common properties/features of a source type.  For
    example, when you select a media source, VLC source, or the slideshow
    source, you'll get media controls to control playback of the media.  If
    you select a text source you can edit the font, color, or text if
    applicable.  Or if you select a capture source, you can select the
    display/window/etc to capture for that source.
    
    If the source toolbar is not desired and is viewed as taking up valuable
    space in the window, it can be disabled via the view menu.

    Facebook provides CDN endpoints for users to optimize their bandwidth or

    streamers use a custom server endpoint that looks like
    "rtmps://edgetee-upload-fml.xx.fbcdn.net:443/rtmp/".
    
    This diff adds detection to users using the custom field for CDN
    endpoints so we can show the stream key link button.

    It is undefined behavior to apply an offset to a null pointer. I would

    https://reviews.llvm.org/D67122 .

    libobs: Fix deferred update sometimes using stale data
    
    Currently we use a bool flag to signal the video thread that it should
    call obs_source_deferred_update. This does not work correctly when the
    update callback is slow and the update is triggered faster than the
    callback can complete.
    
    For example:
    * the settings are set to state A
    * defer_update is set
    * obs_source_deferred_update is called and enters into the callback
    * the callback starts making use of the settings in state A
    * the settings are set to state B
    * defer_update stays set
    * the callback finishes
    * defer_update is set to false
    
    Now defer_update is false but the callback has only observed settings in
    state A but not B.
    
    This commit fixes this bug by keeping an update counter. If the counter
    has changed while we were in the callback we know that we need to update
    again.
    
    The counter is atomic. The current version uses a plain bool which is a
    data race as the value is written and read in parallel.

    Process queues upfront in OBS_CreateDevice, and not lazily in
    OBS_GetDeviceQueue.
    
    Handle failed node allocation for OBS_CreateInstance, OBS_CreateDevice,
    and OBS_CreateSwapchainKHR.
    
    Handle VK_NULL_HANDLE for OBS_DestroySurfaceKHR and
    OBS_DestroySwapchainKHR.
    
    Add temporary code path CTS_WORKAROUND to deal with CTS sharing surfaces
    between instances.
    
    Fix return value for OBS_DestroyInstance.
    
    Add missing _freea calls, required for _malloca.
    
    Make sure the queue passed to OBS_QueuePresentKHR supports transfer to
    safely call vkCmdCopyImage.
    
    Update GetInstanceProcAddr/GetDeviceProcAddr to conform closer to spec.
    
    Remove extra macros because I dislike indirection more than verbosity.

    This prevents a stale texture from being visible for a single frame when
    there is no preloaded video.

    libobs: Update async texture when showing preloaded video
    
    The previous preloaded video behavior updated the texture on preload
    rather than when the video was shown, during which time the texture may
    have been modified by other processes, resulting in the wrong frame
    being displayed.

    UI: Remove OBSContext class and shutdown in run_program
    
    The OBSContext never called obs_startup but would always call
    obs_shutdown in its destructor, resulting in shutdown calls even if
    libobs wasn't initialized (eg due to a startup error). Instead, we now
    track if libobs was initialized in OBSApp and call shutdown in the
    destructor.

    deps/media-playback: Reset TS when seeking
    
    If seeking occurs too close to the previous time value, it could cause
    the playback to delay an abnormal amount of time, or if the time value
    is under the previous value, then it would cause an assert.  So instead,
    reset the next timestamp value to be instant in both cases if a seek
    occurs to ensure timely playback.

    This commit fixes the case of two recently added attributes of the
    v4l2_data struct (in PR #2978). The new attributes were named
    "frameRateUnchanged" and "resolutionUnchanged", i.e. using CamelCase
    while all other attributes use snake_case. This change changes the
    name of the two attributes to snake_case.

    UI: Make color consistent, don't show alpha value
    
    The color picker loads the label not showing alpha hex value but on
    color change then shows the alpha level in the hex value (which is
    hardcoded to 255).
    
    This changes so the label always shows only RGB value.
    
    Of course, can be easily changed back to ::Arbg later if a alpha picker
    is added.

    obs-ffmpeg: Allow continuous network streaming
    
    This change breaks the tying of the 'close' option to the media
    source being a local file vs. network source. In doing so, it is
    possible to keep network sources streaming continuously, which
    fixes a few things when using network cameras as sources:
    
    * The preview pane works in studio mode.
    * There is no delay in switching scenes before video appears.
    * The multiview works properly/normally.
    
    This does introduce one bit of weirdness which could be easily fixed
    with sufficient knowledge of OBS to do it quickly: if a networked media
    source fails with both 'Restart playback when source becomes active' and
    'Close file when inactive' disabled, it is slightly tricky to get it to
    restart the video stream. (It can be done by enabling those options and
    hiding the scene, though.) It would be nice to have a simple "restart
    stream" button somewhere to do this more easily.

    UI: Add virtual camera to UI
    
    Adds a virtual camera button to the main user interface.  If virtual
    camera is not installed, it will not add the button.  On Windows, it
    detects whether the virtual camera filters are properly registered, and
    will only add the button if the virtual camera filter is confirmed
    registered.
    
    Also adds a virtual camera option to the auto-configuration wizard,
    which will just simply set the user's resolution/scale to 1920x1080 at
    30 FPS.

    win-dshow: Add Virtual Camera (Windows)
    
    The virtual camera adds the ability to use the output of OBS itself as a
    camera that can be selected within other Windows applications.  This is
    very loosely based upon the catxfish virtual camera plugin design.
    
    There is a shared memory queue, but instead of having 10-20 frames in
    the queue, there are now only 3 frames in the queue to minimize latency
    and reduce memory usage.  The third frame is mostly to ensure that
    writing does not occur on the same frame being read; the delay is merely
    one frame at all times.
    
    The frames of the shared memory queue are NV12 instead of YUYV, which
    reduces the memory and data copied, as well as eliminate unnecessary
    conversion from NV12.  Some programs (such as chrome, which uses webrtc
    to capture) do not support NV12 however, so an I420 conversion is
    provided, which is far less expensive than YUYV.  The CPU cost of NV12
    -> I420 is negligible in comparison.
    
    The virtual camera filter itself is based upon the output filter within
    the libdshowcapture library, which was originally implemented for other
    purposes.  This is more ideal than the Microsoft example code because
    for one, it's far less convoluted, two, allows us to be able to
    customize the filter to our needs a bit more easily, and three, has much
    better RAII.  The Microsoft CBaseFilter/etc code comprised of about 30
    source files, where as the output filter comprises of two or three
    required source files which we already had, so it's a huge win to
    compile time.
    
    Scaling is avoided whenever possible to minimize CPU usage.  When the
    virtual camera is activated in OBS, the width, height, and frame
    interval are saved, that way if the filter is activated, it will always
    remember the last OBS resolution/interval that the virtual camera was
    activated with, even if OBS is not active.  If for some reason the
    filter activates before OBS starts up, and OBS starts up with a
    different resolution, it will use simple point scaling intermittently,
    and then will remember the new scaling in the future.  The scaler could
    use some optimization.  FFmpeg was not opted for because the FFmpeg DLLs
    would have to be provided for both architectures, which would be about
    30 megabytes in total, and would make writing the plugin much more
    painful.  Thus a simple point scaling algorithm is used, and scaling is
    avoided whenever possible.
    
    (If another willing participant wants to have a go at improving the
    scaling then go for it.  But otherwise, it avoids scaling whenever
    possible anyway, so it's not a huge deal)

    win-capture: Reset command pool rather than buffer
    
    Reorganize data to avoid best practices layer warning. Sort of a false
    positive in our case because we only have one buffer per pool now, but
    implicit layers should be clean citizens.

    image-source: Don't check for changes when hidden
    
    If an image source isn't visible there is no point polling for changes
    during the time it's hidden as no one will see them. Should the image
    be on unreachable media such as an unavailable network share, this
    check would cause the graphics thread to periodically stall trying to
    detect changes of a non-visible image source.
    
    If the image is modified while it's hidden, the updated file will now
    be loaded as soon as the source is made visible - the update timer
    intentionally ticks up while hidden.
    
    Partially fixes some of the behavior described in
    https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/3007, a full fix
    likely requires significant changes to support OS-specific file change
    notification APIs.

    libobs: Unload modules while OBS core is active
    
    Modules are now unloaded while OBS core is still active, allowing
    modules that call into libobs in their unload function to continue to
    work. This changes the behavior of such calls - previously they were a
    no-op since the OBS core would be gone, but they are now executed with
    the OBS core still being active.

    libobs: Remove excessive null checks
    
    libobs functions check for a null obs_core inconsistently. If the core
    is null, the functions silently return with no indication of an error to
    the API user. This commit removes all null checks in libobs functions
    that require libobs to be initialized. For OBS Studio, we are
    (hopefully!) using the API properly so this should have no impact.

    win-capture: Improve Vulkan synchronization
    
    Use general layout and 0 access masks for external synchronization as
    specified in the spec.
    
    Also set pipeline stages for maximum synchronization just in case
    because it doesn't seem like the pipeline stages are specified.
    
    "Vulkan-incompatible APIs will require the image to be in the GENERAL
    layout whenever they are accessing them."
    
    "Whilst it is not invalid to provide destination or source access masks
    for memory barriers used for release or acquire operations,
    respectively, they have no practical effect. Access after a release
    operation has undefined results, and so visibility for those accesses
    has no practical effect. Similarly, write access before an acquire
    operation will produce undefined results for future access, so
    availability of those writes has no practical use. In an earlier version
    of the specification, these were required to match on both sides - but
    this was subsequently relaxed. These masks should be set to 0."

    linux-v4l2: Selective stream restart
    
    This commit adds a basic check to see if the v4l2 stream requires a
    restart. This is primarly implemented on the basis of the fact that
    the options requiring a restart have values stored in the v4l2_data
    structure. A restart is only needed if any of the values have changed
    since the last update.

    UI: Set 8x8 as minimum selectable resolution
    
    Since libobs internally rounds to various powers of 2 to support SSE
    functions, resolutions that are too low can get rounded to zero. libobs
    will fail to startup with a zero resolution, so if a user accidentally
    entered anything that rounded to zero OBS would become unusable without
    manual fixing by editing the profile .ini.

    cmake: Fix warnings and normalize variables/errors
    
    As of 3.17 using find_package_handle_standard_args checks that the name
    of the FindXXX file and the first argument are the same case.
    
    Some modules used non-standard variables or the old singular variables
    instead of plurals. This normalizes variable usage to the new-style.
    
    Some CMakeLists.txt did custom error checking instead of propagating
    find_package errors. These were changes to call find_package with
    REQUIRED or without QUIET where needed and shortens the custom status
    messages. This helps users who want to enable that functionality see
    what precisely wasnt found.

    UI: Fix GetUnusedSceneCollectionFile filename creation
    
    GetUnusedSceneCollectionFile tries to create a safe, unused filename for
    a new scene collection JSON file based on the user-specified scene
    collection name. It would check the length of the safe version of the
    user-specified name, but then it doesn't consider that the length may
    have changed when GetClosestUnusedFileName was called to alter the
    filename to prevent filename collisions by adding an incremented integer
    to the end of the filename. This could result in OBS thinking a filename
    was safe and available, but the resulting filename could be one that
    already exists. OBS could then overwrite a scene collection JSON file
    with this new file without any indication that the file previously
    existed.
    
    Instead of trying to calculate a length based off of the returned
    filename, let's just use the length of the config path since it's a
    known string.

    obs-x264: Log ignored options
    
    When an x264 option doesn't include a "=", it is silently ignored. This

    ignored.
    
    Aside from logging, this commit should not change behavior.

    handled by obs-x264 itself. Change the log message to omit skipped
    options.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix AVFrame handling in FFmpeg output
    
    Fix an issue in the way AVFrames were handled in the FFmpeg
    encoder plugin, which could lead to tearing in the encoded
    video due to data races in the AVFrame and AVBuffer.
    
    This is fixed by calling av_frame_make_writable which ensures
    the frame and its associated buffer are writable. If its not,
    it will copy the AVFrame, create a new AVBuffer for it and
    decrease the refcount of the old AVFrame and AVBuffer.
    This way OBS always ends up with a usable buffer to write into
    which is not still used by the encoder while avoiding a copy
    when unnecessary.

    it was started elevated and launch OBS from the elevated context.
    
    Also applies the altered working directory to the non-elevated code
    path so it can find the OBS executable properly.

    deps/glad: Fix build with GCC-10
    
    GCC-10 defaults to '-fno-common' [1], which triggers issues with
    defining global variables multiple times.  To fix the build, use
    'extern' to turn the first definition of 'gladGetProcAddressPtr'
    into a declaration.

    obs-ffmpeg: Update error message in process_packet
    
    The error message in the process_packet function was prefixed with
    "receive_audio" because it was previously from code in the encode_audio
    function which was called from the receive_audio function. This is just
    a string change to avoid being misled to believe that the error is
    always audio related.

    obs-filters: Add a user label to the LUT filter
    
    While discussing the Flatpak RFC [1], it was spotted that the
    LUT filter couldn't open the file selection dialog. It was
    explained, then, that the proper formats were either composed
    of "User Label (file extensions)", or "file extensions", and
    the LUT filter was setting "(file extensions)" without the
    actual user label.
    
    While this works on a standard Qt file selection dialog, it
    cannot be properly formatted as a set of D-Bus filters, thus
    breaking the sandbox integration.
    
    Add a simple user label to the LUT file filter.

    UI: Adjust a few margins
    
    -Remove 9px margins around central widget. This saves 18px of vertical
    space. This will be helpful when the source context menu is added,
    which is 24px tall.
    
    -Adjusts margins in transitions dock. The top of the transitions dock
    wasn't lined up with the top of the controls dock, which made it look
    bad.

    increase performance. The option to select old QSV pipeline still
    remains and will fallback if new pipeline fails.

    UI: Fix warning when compiling with Clang 10
    
    Building with Clang 10 on FreeBSD 13-CURRENT emitted a warning about
    logical not (!) applying only to the left hand side of a comparison.
    Update the expression to match the style of other flags conditionals.
    Verified that object code is the same.

    UI: Properly apply hide cursor on fullscreen projectors
    
    If a projector was created fullscreen, the isFullScreen() call would
    fail since the window hasn't been displayed by Qt yet, resulting in the
    cursor hiding choice not being applied. This moves the cursor hiding
    into the SetMonitor call which is used for all code paths creating a
    fullscreen projector, ensuring the setting is applied.
    
    Fixes https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2687

    cmake: Fix warnings and normalize variables/errors
    
    As of 3.17 using find_package_handle_standard_args checks that the name
    of the FindXXX file and the first argument are the same case.
    
    Some modules used non-standard variables or the old singular variables
    instead of plurals. This normalizes variable usage to the new-style.
    
    Some CMakeLists.txt did custom error checking instead of propagating
    find_package errors. These were changes to call find_package with
    REQUIRED or without QUIET where needed and shortens the custom status
    messages. This helps users who want to enable that functionality see
    what precisely wasnt found.

    obs-ffmpeg: Rename and add more VAAPI levels
    
    The Auto level lets the encoder decide which level to use.
    Furthermore, some devices allow levels beyond 4.2. Therefore,
    we add all levels allowed by H.264. This is of importance,
    since using a resolution not supported by the specified level
    can trigger undefined behavior on the hardware/kernel.

    libobs: Fix macOS 10.15 hotkey crash (temporary)
    
    On 10.15, if a user activates secure input of some sort, the hotkey code
    will begin to crash inside of any Apple function related to hotkeys,
    even after secure input has ended.  This does not appear to be the fault
    of OBS; the reason to this is still as of yet unknown, but is suspected
    to be a bug inside of Apple code that's a new regression as of 10.15.
    
    So for the time being as a temporary solution to the crash, simply
    disable external hotkey support once secure input has been detected.
    
    Because of this issue, the hotkey code should probably be replaced by a
    different method of tracking hotkeys, perhaps InstallEventHandler for
    example.  This commit is little more than a bandaid to the crash.

    CI: Make processor count consistent
    
    Code formatting script was using `sysctl -n hw.physicalcpu` on macOS
    machines to get the CPU count. This command returns the physical CPUs.
    `nproc`, however, returns logical CPU count on Linux machines. It
    should be `sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu` to make it consistent with its
    Linux counterpart. But there also another way. `getconf
    _NPROCESSORS_ONLN` gives the number of logical CPUs on both Linux and
    macOS.

    Previous fix in #2547 altered id before they were handed off to
    callbacks and v4l2 wont strip its own flags from ids resulting in
    invalid ids in the ioctl.
    
    Instead add cleanup section and jump all branches there before looping.
    
    (Jim edit: I'm changing this entire function so that it isn't horrible.)

    UI: Fix silent scenes with imported SL scenes
    
    Previously, the importer assumed scenes had fields that sources did for
    audio, namely volume, sync, mute and monitoring type. SL scenes do not
    have these fields. This resulted in mistakes in importing, such as
    imported scenes having a volume of 0.0.
    
    This change gets rid of the non-existent fields, and explicitly sets the
    volume of the scenes to 1.0 as a precaution.

    UI: Set correct window title for fullscreen projector
    
    Before this change, opening up a fullscreen projector would have the
    wrong window title (Windowed Projector). This was because the call to
    update the window title was called before a monitor is set, and the
    title is determined by whether a monitor is set.
    
    This change moves the update title call to after the geometry or monitor
    gets set, ensuring the window title is correct.

    win-capture: Retry with last known window if first fails
    
    This fixes a bug where games like "Don't Starve Together" wouldn't
    capture because their actual render window is a completely different
    window than their actual window on the screen.
    
    So, because we already have the hook info by this point with the last
    known window handle available, instead of using 0 here, we can just use
    the window handle provided by the shared memory.  And we didn't even
    have to change the hook!  That's nice.

    The program can get stuck waiting for the browser within a event queue,

    signal the window when it's finished, and then check whether it's in the
    process of closing before actually showing the dialog.

    linux-capture: Use RandR monitors for screen information
    
    RandR has two sets of screen geometry information:
    
     1. CRTC. These are the physical scanout engines in the hardware
    
     2. Monitors. These are the logical partitions of the screen.
    
    By default, each CRTC gets mapped to a Monitor. However, some monitors
    actually require two CRTCs to drive them due to limitations in the
    scanout hardware. Users can also create 'virtual' monitors to support
    VNC or other systems.
    
    This patch makes the RandR code prefer the Monitor mechanism to the
    older CRTC mechanism. If the server doesn't support a new enough RandR
    version, the existing CRTC code is used instead.
    
    The name of the monitor is also provided in place of the arbitrary
    number to help users select the desired source.

    libobs: Fix source type versioning system
    
    (This also modifies image-source, obs-text, text-freetype2, and UI)
    
    This improves source definition versioning.  To do this, it now stores
    two identifier names.  One "unversioned" which is the original name, and
    one "versioned" with the version number appended.
    
    This fixes both backward compatibility with older OBS versions, and
    fixes the inability to use "add existing" in OBS itself on sources
    created from older version definitions.

    image-source: Don't use video info for color source size
    
    The problem with using obs_get_video_info for a default is that the user
    can change that value.  A default should not be a value that is subject
    to change based upon the user's settings.
    
    Instead, choose a sane "normal" value, like 1920x1080.  Later on, this
    should be replaced with a system that allows automatic resizing via the
    user.

    reacquire.

    window and not the main VLC window itself.

    UI: Fix scenes as sources for SL import
    
    The previous fix for repeated names accidentally meant that if a scene
    item in a scene was meant to show another scene that was lower in the
    list, it would fail to create the item, and wouldn't make it into the
    imported collection.
    
    This fix makes sure that scenes as sources still works properly in that
    situation.

    UI: Don't add removed sources when refreshing LoadAudioSources
    
    This can be fired by a callback during source removal. The code was
    re-adding the source that was just removed, causing the program to
    freeze when trying to remove all sources.

    UI: Use invokeMethod to refresh LoadAudioSources
    
    Sources may be removed or destroyed by other threads which resulted in
    GUI calls outside of the main Qt thread.

    win-capture: Check hook version before capture init
    
    Checks the hook version to ensure compatibility with hook DLL.  It's
    unlikely it'll ever be necessary to increment the hook version, but this
    is just a precautionary thing that allows a hook DLL to make sure it's
    rejected by an older OBS version if needed.  Again however, very
    unlikely that the major version will ever be incremented.

    win-capture: Use full DLL path for inject helper
    
    The inject helper should be able to specify the full path rather than
    assume the path of the hook DLL.  This change allows us to modify the
    hook's location.  This needs to be done because the hook needs to be
    relocated to ProgramData to prevent the possibility of multiple Vulkan
    capture hooks.

    CI: Fix case of PlugIns directory
    
    'PlugIns' is normal for MacOS and whatever is generating qt.conf
    (macdeployqt?) is using 'PlugIns', so this both builds and generates
    an app that works on case insensitive filesystems but fails to load
    on case sensitive filesystems.
    
    I haven't tested building the installer, only modifying the
    qt.conf in the installed copy of OBS.app.

    This reverts commit ff22c20019115adee471328f729588db0115f45f.
    
    This caused a bug in FTL output, which started hitching after this
    commit.  Presumably due to opus; it's likely you're not supposed to do
    this with all audio encoders.

    win-capture: Preserve current window setting
    
    This re-uses the game capture code for checking whether the original
    window still exists or not.  If it doesn't or the name changed, it'll
    insert the value at the top of the list so it doesn't automatically
    select another when the user opens properties.
    
    Basically, this fixes an issue where opening properties could sometimes
    cause it to instantly capture whatever window was at the top of the
    list, which is undesirable.

    UI: Use deleteLater() rather than explicit delete
    
    When an audio source is removed, it signals its "destroy" callbacks.
    One of the callbacks is OBSSourceLabel::SourceDestroyed.  When its Qt
    destroy signal is fired, it causes a call to LoadAudioSources to refresh
    the source list.  LoadAudioSources deletes the old layout, and so the
    QWidget that the OBSSource is based on is freed while it's still in the
    middle of running the signal callback, resulting in access to freed
    memory.

    libobs/util: Retry pipe writes to avoid short-write failures
    
    Previously, any short write would be treated elsewhere as a failure. The
    easiest solution is to have pipe_write() automatically retry until either
    it's written everything, or it couldn't write anything at all.

    win-capture: Add 'auto' method to window capture
    
    Adds an "Automatic" method to the capture method property of window
    capture.  This allows the ability for window capture to automatically
    determine the best capture method to use.  Primarily, it prefers BitBlt
    in most cases, but will use WGC when it detects the window is a browser,
    microsoft office, or a UWP program.
    
    This was implemented because the new capture method has a number of
    undesired effects associated with it -- the issue of the capture border
    that we can do nothing about, the fact that we can't control the capture
    of the cursor, and the fact that Microsoft designed it to switch the
    cursor away from hardware cursor mode when the capture is active (there
    was absolutely no reason to do this because even OBS can capture the
    hardware cursor with no issue).  Until we get a new version of this API
    that doesn't absolutely blow, we're stuck preferring BitBlt instead.
    
    But hey, at least people will be able to capture browser windows now.

    win-capture: Windows Graphics Capture support
    
    Users will now have the option of legacy window capture via BitBlt, or
    Windows Graphics Capture, which is new to Windows 10.
    
    There are two annoyances with the new capture method though. One is that
    there is a bright, yellow border added to the original window (but not
    the OBS view of it). The other is that the mouse cursor is always
    captured, and we won't be able to capture without cursor until a later
    version of Windows 10 is released.
    
    It should also be noted that DPI scaling is now applied, which may
    result in blurrier images caused by Windows rescaling.

    libobs: Don't strip whitespace from config values
    
    A plugin that saves whitespace-only data would crash OBS on startup as
    the whitespace stripping would send the string length negative. While
    that bug is fixed in this commit, there is also no good reason that OBS
    is stripping whitespace to begin with. All data going into the configs
    should be well formed and some plugins legitimately wish to save
    whitespace as a config option (eg for search / replace characters).

    obs-outputs: Properly reset stream count on RTMP_Close
    
    Every addStream call would increment this counter. After merging the
    mbedTLS fixes, we no longer have extraneous RTMP_Init calls which were
    masking the prescence of this bug. This caused every stream after the
    first stream to have the wrong channel index, and eventually OBS would
    crash due to an out of bounds write if the counter reached
    RTMP_MAX_STREAMS.

    UI: Don't set audio encoder track index in Adv Output
    
    The audio track should always be 0 for RTMP output. The previous code
    accidentally used the audio track index to set the encoder track index.
    If the chosen audio track was track 2, this enabled the experimental
    multi-track RTMP output code. This then caused streams to fail as if
    there were network problems, as popular RTMP services like Twitch don't
    understand the multi-track RTMP stream and the connection hangs.

    win-capture: Fix hook collisions with multiple game captures
    
    Before this change, after a game capture source would send a signal to
    init or restart a graphics hook, it would respond to any and all hook
    ready signals.
    
    With multiple game capture sources in the same scene, a source could
    receive the signal intended for another source, and show the wrong
    texture.
    
    This change adds the window handle to the name for shared data with the
    hook, resulting in hooks for other sources being ignored.

    obs-vth264: Manually mark priority bits for VideoToolbox frames
    
    Reland of 30d29618, except actually tested this time.
    
    The VideoToolbox encoder gives I-frames and P-frames a priority of 1,
    but the RTMP output code expects I-frames to have priority 3 and
    P-frames to have priority 2.
    
    30d29618 changed the priority of all frames that aren't I-frames, but
    that included B-frames as well as P-frames. B-frames are given a
    priority of 0 by VideoToolbox and changing that priority causes
    artifacts for reasons I don't understand. So ignore the B-frames by
    ignoring slice packets with priority 0.

    UI: Add advanced scene collection importer

    UI: Add advanced scene collection importer
    
    This replaces the previous Open File dialog for importing collections
    with a window for importing many collections at once, based on the remux
    window, along with support for importing from OBS Classic, XSplit
    Broadcaster and from Streamlabs' fork. This also translates sources
    between OSes that Studio supports.

    libobs: Add group functions that can signal refresh
    
    Adds API:
    obs_scene_add_group2
    obs_scene_insert_group2
    obs_sceneitem_group_ungroup2
    
    These functions should be used by plugins if they need to use these
    functions and need to send a refresh signal.  If a major API rework ever
    happens the old functions should be removed.  The old functions should
    eventually be deprecated.
    
    The reason why specifying a 'signal' parameter is useful is because it's
    a bit more seamless for the user interface to be able to have custom
    handling of these specific cases.  It looks better and doesn't require
    completely erasing/recreating the entire list, which is visually
    unappealing.

    win-capture: Faster display / window capture updates
    
    When changing the target for display or window capture, force a
    refresh of the source by setting the timer to fire immediately. This
    removes 1-3 seconds of "lag" before the new display or window is
    visible and makes the UI feel more responsive.
    
    Closes https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2322

    UI: Always prompt when updates are available
    
    The current updater code won't prompt the user if an output is active or
    if game capture is in use. These are both fairly common situations to be
    in as soon as OBS starts up - for example, the NDI and VirtualCam
    plugins both start outputs automatically, and a game capture source will
    hook if the game is open.
    
    It should be fairly obvious to a user that OBS will be closed when an

    libobs/util: Fix incorrect assertion in darray_insert_array
    
    Previously the assertion required the idx to be smaller than the number
    of elements in the darray. This would mean you could not insert anything
    at the end of a darray, and would make it impossible to insert an array
    into an empty darray.

    The report in https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2350
    identified the issue as being caused by mbedtls not following symbolic
    links, but it turns out the issue was the mbedtls_x509_crt_parse_path
    return value which was already fixed in 4d89123c. So these changes are
    no longer necessary.

    obs-outputs: Fix librtmp mbedtls thread safety
    
    Per mbedtls documentation, "If you share a context between threads, you
    need to call these functions only from the main thread, at the beginning
    and end of the context's lifetime.". OBS violated this since librtmp
    uses a global context and it was allocated and freed in different
    threads such as the auto config test.
    
    This commit attaches the mbedtls context to an RTMP structure so there
    is no more global state. It also fixes a rare double-free crash that
    could occur if RTMP_TLS_Free was called twice (this happened in rare
    situations such as the auto config running followed by a mode change
    from Advanced to Simple).

    SIMDE was introduced for aarch64 support, however, the library itself
    supports non-SIMD fallback, which allows us provide support to other
    platforms without code changes.
    
    There is another world beyond x86. So we can simply enable SIMDE for
    processors without SSE2 support.

    libobs: Add the ability to make sources obsolete
    
    This allows the ability to do things such as change defaults or
    properties of sources without necessarily breaking older user
    configurations that had older defaults or properties.

    UI: Fix studio mode transition bugs
    
    -If the user were in the middle of a transition and clicked
    the cut transition, the transitions would become borked.
    
    -This actually disables the transition widgets, so the
    user doesn't click them. Before, the disabling of the
    widgets didn't work as expected. The code for enabling/disabling
    them was also simplified.
    
    -This loading of studio mode was moved in OBSInit because
    the loading of transitions needs to happen first. This fixes
    a bug when enabling/disabling the t-bar when the program
    is first loaded. The t-bar would be disabled even if a
    cut or stinger transition was not used.
    
    -When the user would click the quick transitions, the
    t-bar would be enabled even when it was not supposed
    to.

    librtmp: Allow partial success for mbedtls
    
    mbedtls_x509_crt_parse_path returns a positive number if it partially
    succeeds and a negative number on complete failure. This changes the
    positive result to no longer error and prevent TLS connections (OBS
    verifies all endpoints so having no CA chain prevents TLS).

    obs-outputs: Fix mbedtls use of deprecated functions
    
    mbedtls_md5_starts(), mbedtls_md5_update() and mbedtls_md5_finish()
    have been marked deprecated since mbedtls version 2.7 and may go
    away in the future.
    
    These function have been superseded by versions with a return
    value. They are suffixed with "_ret". We do not actually check
    return values.
    
    Also the header "mbedtls/net.h" has been superseded by
    "mbedtls/net_sockets.h".

    libobs: Find windows version
    
    This uses three methods of obtaining the actual windows version,
    RtlGetVersion which is the ntdll version of GetVersionEx that bypasses
    the manifest check garbage, looking up the file version of a file that
    is most likely to be updated per windows version (ntoskrnl), and the
    registry.  Of the three values, it chooses the highest windows version
    obtained by the three.

    libobs: Add manual transition "torque" support
    
    Allows the ability for manual transitioning to smoothly flow
    (interpolate) to the intended transition point over a short period of
    time rather than simply setting a hard transition point number.  Doing
    this allows manual transitioning to occur more smoothly, and in a more
    visually pleasant way.

    libobs-opengl: OpenGL thread-safety on Mac
    
    Attempt to fix threading issues that cause OBS to force-crash when
    compiled with latest Xcode. There are two places where the new SDK
    introduces a force-crash because operations are not happening on the
    main thread: when we modify the context view to switch swap chains, and
    when we resize a swap chain.
    
    Instead of using just one context for all rendering, we create an
    additional context for each swap chain, set each view once on
    initialization, and switch contexts only in present to blit the final
    framebuffer. This is an extra copy, but it's pretty hairy to optimize
    away, and it's not worth potential regressions just to speed up Mac.
    
    For resizing, we schedule the update code to run on the main thread from
    the render thread. Ideally, we wouldn't have to round trip the logic
    from main thread to graphics thread and back, but I don't think we want
    to hack up the interface for this, especially since OpenGL will give way
    to Metal soon enough.

    libobs: Fix corrupted pointers when removing properties
    
    When obs_properties_remove_by_name is called on any obs_properties_t*,
    it corrupts the pointers for first_property and last which end up
    pointing at either unallocated memory or randomly into the heap memory.
    Neither of these is a good thing, and it usually leads to rapid
    unscheduled program behavior, also known as crashing and security
    issues.
    
    This fixes the issue by first checking if the pointer stored in
    props->last is identical to &cur->next, then checking if we are the
    only element (cur is also prev element), and if we are then the pointer
    is fixed to point back at props->first_property. Additionally fixes
    props->first_property which was never updated either.

    UI: Ensure OBS launches when theme is missing
    
    This change makes it so OBS will still launch even if a theme is
    missing. This change also deprecates the "CurrentTheme" config key, and
    is replaced by "CurrentTheme2".
    
    This is because a previous change to make sure OBS fell back to the
    System theme in case of a missing theme had been accidentally removed.
    Changing the key prevents a new version of OBS setting a theme that
    doesn't exist in an older version, which would prevent that version from
    launching.

    UI: Add Start Streaming settings check on start
    
    When we use the server error to respond to user's failing to start a
    stream it is slow to return an error and unclear to the user what went
    wrong. This diff introduces a simple settings check before attempting
    to stream and catch and explain specific URL/key issues to the user.
    
    In the case of preset services we check there is a Stream Key before
    attempting to start a stream.
    
    In the case of "custom" we only verify there is a URL since for some
    services that's all that is required or the user may use user/password
    authentication.

    UI: Create UI Validation Helper Class
    
    Pull UI validation and its helpers to their own class. This class will
    be used to validate forms and perform UI-action checks such as
    checking stream keys aren't empty and in this diff now holds the logic
    to ensure there is a source before the person starts a stream.

    UI: Delete cookies before connecting account
    
    Fixes an issue where when trying to connect a Twitch account, and the
    Twitch two-factor authentication check fails, the user will still
    technically be logged in because the cookies will still be present, thus
    when they try to click the "Connect" button again, it will skip the
    login part (because they're already technically logged in), and just
    give them the two-factor failure message without letting them enter in
    their login information again.

    UI: Fix bug in untested/unused function code path
    
    In the current user interface code, OBSBasic::AddSceneCollection has a
    qname parameter to allow explicitly specifying a name, but that code
    path is unused in the UI code itself, and qname is typically empty.  If
    qname is not empty, it does not properly generate a file name associated
    with that specified scene collection name.  This fixes that issue.

    Adds an option to the right click menu in the scenes widget to switch

    grid mode, it'll let you select list mode. Grid mode changes the scenes
    widget to have a grid of buttons for scenes rather than a list, much
    like XSplit.

    deps/media-playback: Don't use interrupt cb for local files
    
    This fixes an issue where local files were using the avformat interrupt
    callback, which is only supposed to be use to prevent blocking on
    network calls.

commit 2fae85ab4a42f26381d22ea0c64ca3c8ed45c5cc
Author: jp9000 <obs.jim@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 25 22:51:20 2019 -0800

    deps/media-playback: Don't exit thread on AVERROR_EXIT
    
    The interrupt callback is designed to prevent the media source from
    blocking; FFmpeg will internally call it periodically to prevent FFmpeg
    function calls from blocking too long, and allow the caller to determine
    whether blocking should stop.
    
    The problem with this however is that AVERROR_EXIT causes the thread to
    completely exit.  This fixes it so that it treats it as an EOF rather
    than as an abnormal error.

    linux-capture: Fix cursor draw bug when cropping window cap.
    
    When cropping the left or top of a window capture, OBS would misalign
    the drawn cursor, placing it as if the entire window were being
    captured. Instead, offset the captured cursor by the same number of
    pixels, thus placing the cursor back where it belongs.

    UI: Fix wrong icon if recording stopped while paused
    
    Fixes pause icon getting stuck if you stream or use replay buffer while
    recording, pause, then stop recording while paused.  The icon would get
    stuck on the pause icon until all outputs were stopped.

    UI: Add setting for Twitch chat add-ons choice
    
    Both BTTV and FFZ are fairly popular however they do occasionally
    interfere.  To give users the option to chose whichever one they like
    most we add a new setting that allows BTTV, FFZ, both, or neither.
    
    Defaults to "None" for new users.  Existing users will be migrated to
    "Both" as that's the previous behavior.

    UI: Fix Twitch panels not using dark first time
    
    When the panels start up for the very first time, the dark theme is not
    used due to the local storage variable not being set by the first panel.
    When the program is restarted, it'll be dark from then on out because
    it's set by the secondary panels rather than the primary panel.  This
    modifies it so that the locale storage variable is properly set by the
    primary panel.

    obs-scripting: Fix Python in new MacOS .app bundles
    
    The current scripting directory path given to Python on OSX is
    `../data/obs-scripting`. This works when bin/ and data/ are in the same
    folder like rundir after a compile and in the old .app bundles but the
    new normal .app bundle structure is different.
    
    For bundles move obspython.py and _obspython.so to the binary folder,
    just like the Lua one, and pass that bin path to the Python interpreter
    so it can find it.
    
    The current working dir isn't guaranteed to be set with .app bundles
    so look up binary path at runtime.

    win-dshow: Support bottom-up DIBs
    
    The biHeight field can be negative, leading to crashes on some cards
    like VisionRGB-E1S. Adding flip support is fairly straightforward.
    
    There also appears to be a hack to automatically flip for RGB formats,
    but I wish to remove it because it seems to fight with this change. We
    already have a separate vertical flip checkbox to deal with non
    compliant behavior.

    win-capture: Fix rare crash when GL program exits
    
    **Commit message modified and clarified by Jim**
    
    When hooking a program that has both DirectX and OpenGL contexts in use,
    it is possible to cause a crash on shutdown due to capture_active()
    returning true when an OpenGL context is deleted.  Normally, when
    capturing an OpenGL program, this would not happen because the 'active'
    variable would not be set due to OpenGL capture not being initialized,
    but if DirectX is captured while an OpenGL context is available, and
    OpenGL could not load these required functions, then GL can crash due to
    trying to use unavailable functions.
    
    This case is extremely rare and doesn't happen under normal
    circumstances; only if a program is using both DirectX and OpenGL within
    the same program simultaneously, and *only* if OpenGL could not load the
    required functions.  This likely almost never happens under normal
    programs, games, and hardware.  This was apparently produced by hooking
    a GL Qt program that used QWebEngine, which used multiple contexts at
    once.

    UI: Upgrade stream link hotlink to a button
    
    Most of the top streaming services now have a link in the stream key
    label. Upgrading this button to a button clarifies the assistance
    for the important step of setting up a stream.
    
    Creates a new type of button for URL opening simply which also
    automatically updates the tootip to the current URL.
    
    Includes addition of Twitter/Periscope URL to make this feature more
    complete.

    obs-ffmpeg: use avcodec_find_best_pix_fmt_of_list
    
    The built-in format selector failed in certain cases like UtVideo now
    using a differently packeg RGB format. FFmpeg has a format selection
    functionality built-in that does pick the correct format however
    (avcodec_find_best_pix_fmt_of_list), so we can simply use that instead.

    enc-amf: Upgrade to v2.6
    
    Deprecated support for drivers that ship an AMF Runtime older than
    version 1.4.14, and older than 19.9.2. This also means Windows 8 is no
    longer supported since AMD has stopped providing driver updates.
    
    Added the new "High Motion Quality Boost" option that is exclusive to
    the new 5700 cards and seems to do nothing on older cards.
    
    Fixed the calculation of the automatic VBV buffer above 50%.
    
    The Video API option will now only list one API, Direct3D 11 on Windows
    10, and Direct3D 9 on Windows 7.

    obs-browser: Remove "monitor by default" flag
    
    The reasoning behind removing this flag is because the whole point of
    having it in was so we could replace chromium's audio output.  But there
    are too many obstacles in our path from doing that for now, so it's
    better to not have this flag because it just causes a lot of browser
    sources to initialize audio monitoring unnecessarily.  We can change
    this in the future, but for now, it's best to let the user choose to
    turn on audio monitoring for the source if they choose to turn on audio
    rerouting to OBS.
    
    Note that this only changes default behavior for newly created sources;
    it will not change settings of existing sources the user had before this
    change.

    This reverts commit 22aa66a6eb520444c492f6a7c595fd7a5de98bdc.
    
    Apparently, starting audio on the fly like this can introduce latency in
    to the audio playback, so for now revert it.  It was a bit of a
    precautionary thing rather than an actual fix anyway, so it probably
    wasn't all that necessary to begin with.

    Apparently, using the old chromium network implementation changes the

    only use the old network implementation on macOS for the time being.

    libobs: Add gs_begin_frame for duplicators
    
    We really shouldn't be resetting duplicator state as part of gs_flush.
    gs_begin_scene is not ideal because it is called twice per frame, and
    only after duplicators have been ticked. Even though it makes no
    user-facing difference, it makes more logical sense to reset at the top
    of the frame than the bottom.

    audio is not being rerouted to OBS.

    obs-browser: Use older chromium network implementation
    
    This uses the older network implementation rather than the new
    NetworkService chromium has implemented until a later version of CEF is
    used.  The newer NetworkService implementation has caused some lag with
    playback when hardware acceleration is not available for whatever
    reason.  This doesn't fix media playback issues with software rendering
    on windows, but it does on macOS.  All playback issues with software
    rendering appear to be fixed in later version of CEF, however those
    versions do not currently have hardware accelerated OSR or audio capture
    support, so we must deal with 3770 until we can upgrade CEF again (which
    hopefully won't be too long).

    Now it's impossible to add OBS to favorites applications in GNOME:

    UI: Remove FFZ from twitch integration
    
    Unfortunately, due to some conflicts between FFZ and BTTV (particularly
    the fact that having FFZ enabled removes the BTTV settings menu items),
    one of them needs to be removed.  For the time being, we'll remove FFZ,
    because BTTV shows FFZ emojis anyway.

    Unbuffered mode is causing the frames of media sources to potentially

    with media sources, just leave buffering on.  There may be a frame or so
    of latency, but it shouldn't be noticeable to most users.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix deadlock with nvenc lookahead
    
    Lookahead requires examining frame data over a large number of frames,
    so when pkv added the change to fully reset the encoder when the bitrate
    changes, nvenc will invalidate all buffers and basically starts over
    from a completely clean slate.
    
    It's possible to make lookahead work when changing the bitrate, but due
    to how lookahead seems to works internally in nvenc, it will cause
    continually increasing latency every time the bitrate is updated, which
    is unideal.
    
    Additionally, when lookahead is enabled, deadlocks can occur when
    changing the bitrate in a thread other than the graphics thread.
    Currently we allow it to be reset outside of the graphics thread.  From
    limited investigating, it would appear this deadlock occurs because
    nvenc is locking and releasing old textures.
    
    So instead of dealing with all these potential issues, disable the
    ability to adjust bitrate when the user has lookahead enabled on nvenc.
    It's not really worth implementing dynamic bitrate support when
    lookahead is enabled if the latency is just going to continually
    increase for every bitrate adjustment anyway.

    _obspython.so currently links directly against python as @rpath/Python
    and has 3 common python install paths set as rpaths so it would only
    work if a user had python installed at one of those hardcoded paths.
    
    Don't link _obspython against python at all but instead link it with
    "-undefined dynamic_lookup" so when it is imported by python all it's
    undefined python symbols get resolved at runtime against the user
    supplied python instance loaded into the process earlier.
    
    The rpaths aren't needed anymore this way.

    obs-browser: Fix a deadlock
    
    This fixes a freeze that can occur if you try to destroy browser while
    another browser is being created.  The CEF UI thread has to wait on a
    window message to the main application UI thread, meanwhile the destroy
    call in the main application UI thread is waiting on the CEF UI thread,
    thus causes a deadlock.
    
    Now that we have the SetParent(hwnd, nullptr) code that detaches the CEF
    window from the Qt window, we no longer have to worry about
    synchronously shutting down the browser, so instead of waiting for that
    operation to finish, just allow it to occur asynchronously.

    obs-browser: Turn rerouting audio off by default
    
    It was determined that rerouting audio through OBS currently isn't the
    best idea even with monitoring enabled, primarily due to the fact that
    audio monitoring has never had this wide of testing before, and that
    many users complained that they were not getting audio for (as of yet)
    unknown reasons from audio monitoring.  It would appear that we need to
    address the issues with audio monitoring first before attempting to use
    audio monitoring with any sources by default.  For now, audio will
    reroute through CEF by default, and then the user must explicitly use
    the option "Control audio via OBS", (renamed from "reroute audio", and
    now disabled by default), to enable browser audio control through OBS.
    
    There are other issues that need to be resolved as well, and once all
    the various issues are addressed, the setting default can be allowed to
    change back.

    This fixes a bug where certain devices (Logitech C920 with latest

    VideoFormat::Any will then select H264 over MJPEG because it's the first
    format value and has the same priority as MJPEG.  So now, MJPEG will be
    prioritized over H264 instead.

    Revert "UI: Various screen reader fixes"
    
    This reverts commit b5843caa484068d6fcc5f5fe8ee2dc06078500ff.
    
    This breaks some hotkeys because the signals are tied to a signal which
    is now triggered because "toggled" is used instead of "clicked", so just
    revert it for now for the release and look at it later post-patch.

    UI: Fix pause hotkey not working properly
    
    Setting the check state cause the toggle signal to trigger, so it would
    pause and immediately unpause.

    obs-browser: Fix portable mode not saving cookies
    
    Request contexts don't appear to work with relative paths, only absolute
    paths.  This fixes the bug where when using portable mode,
    cookies/session wouldn't save because obs_module_config_path() was
    returning a relative path rather than an absolute path.

    UI: Disable NVENC lookahead if dynamic bitrate on
    
    Lookahead causes playback issues when bitrate changes mid-stream.
    Bitrate can suddenly drop to 0, and other issues such as audio
    stuttering on Twitch have been observed.  Turning off lookahead fixed
    the issue.  Lookahead is normally off by default anyway.

    the source's size change out of nowhere.  There needs to be backward
    compatibility implementation for this.

    UI: Various screen reader fixes
    
    This commit fixes various issues with screen readers in the main OBS
    interface. These were tested using NVDA on Windows 10 1903.
    
    Checkboxes or buttons which toggle, when receiving an activate signal
    from the screen reader would visually update, but not perform any
    action. This is because they're listening only for clicks. They should
    all now be listening for toggles instead.
    
    The screen reader would navigate through the UI in the order that
    elements are defined in the .ui XML, and not by their row positions.
    The XML has been reordered so that things should be defined in their row
    order.
    
    Audio track selection now says Track 1, 2, etc, rather than just the
    number. Various checkboxes that just say "Enable" now have accessible
    text that says what the enable is for (since it says "checkbox", the
    fact it's an enable should hopefully be clear). Type in the recording
    tab of output now has accessible text which says "Recording Type".
    
    All the right side buttons in hotkeys now have tooltips, and by
    extension, accessible text. Currently it does not yet say what hotkey
    the action is in relation to, but that would require more locales.

    obs-browser: Do not use WasHidden() for visibility on 3507+
    
    Using WasHidden() for the purposes of visibility no longer can be relied
    upon due to some sort of bug with OSR in Chromium.  This issue does not
    happen when using 3440.  The browser works fine without WasHidden()
    calls, so we must remove its usage or be forced to use 3440.  For those
    who need the visibility handling, an alternative will have to be used
    once it's available.
    
    Additionally, this reverts the failed workaround to use OBS FPS in place
    of SignalBeginFrame() because that code is no longer needed due to the
    WasHidden() removal.

    obs-browser: Fix browser panel crash
    
    Before, we were calling DestroyWindow on the browser panel HWND from the
    CEF UI thread, which meant that the main program thread had to process
    window messages in order for that message to successfully through as
    DestroyWindow blocks on the WM_DESTROY/WM_NCDESTROY window messages.
    Unfortunately, this also had the side-effect of processing all queued Qt
    events, which, when called in the destructor of a window like this, can
    result in undefined behavior; specifically crashes, which were occurring
    due to this.  Especially when browser panels were in docks and docked to
    the main window.
    
    So, instead of calling DestroyWindow in another thread and then
    processing events in the main thread, call DestroyWindow directly in the
    main thread to get WM_DESTROY/WM_NCDESTROY and only those processed on
    the spot.  This appears to fix the crashes due to the undefined
    behavior when closing browser panels.

    libobs: Remove redundant function param and for loop
    
    Originally when the audio_submix function was created, it used all mixer
    tracks, but at a certain point that was removed because it can only use
    the first track, so some older code was unintentionally left over,
    causing the same code to be executed 6 times mistakenly.  This cleans
    that up by removing the unnecessary function parameter and for loop.

    libobs: Make sure to offset unpause audio data
    
    When an unpause occurs, it takes an audio segment and splits it at the
    exact point corresponding to the pause timestamp, and then it's supposed
    to only send the ending part of the split.  However, the audio pointers
    were not being incremented, therefore it was sending the front of the
    audio segment to instead of the back of the audio segment by mistake.

    libobs: Fix pause cutting out video data prematurely
    
    When pause has been activated, the video_pause_check() function is used
    when receiving raw frames in order to filter out frames that are in the
    pause window, that way they aren't sent to the encoder or output.
    
    However, when pause was enabled, it was unintentionally filtering out
    some frames before the specified starting timestamp as well, causing
    extra video data to get cut out prematurely.  This fixes that issue.

    libobs: Fail pause/unpause if still waiting for them
    
    When a pause/unpause occurs, a timestamp is set and the actual
    pause/unpause does not occur until the output/encoders reach the
    specified timestamps.  Do not allow pausing/unpausing unless that point
    has been reached with all encoders of an encoded output or the output
    itself when using a raw output.
    
    This fixes a bug where pause data could get corrupted if
    pausing/unpausing too fast, because the audio/video encoders aren't
    necessarily synchronized and although one encoder may have unpaused, the
    other encoder(s) may not have yet.  Checking all encoders first before
    allowing a pause/unpause ensures that doesn't occur.

    libobs: Give a little extra time for pause to start/stop
    
    Audio latency can get really low, and if it's low enough, the timestamp
    can be passed by the audio subsystem before it's had a chance to pause
    with it.  So instead, make the pause have a little bit of extra delay to
    ensure that doesn't occur.

    deps/media-playback: Fix hw decode dropping last few frames
    
    Fixes a bug where hardware frames would not transfer to RAM for the last
    few frames of a video.  The 'ret' variable can be 0 even though there
    are still frames ready.

    deps/media-playback: Fix memory leak
    
    The hardware accelerated decoder context needs to be explicitly unrefed

    deps/media-playback: Fix hw accel decode crash
    
    When hardware accelerated decoding is enabled, sometimes it can't
    initialize for whatever reason, so it will fall back to software on its
    own.  When this occurs, it will not use the hardware pixel format on the
    frame; instead it will defer to a standard format on the frame.  So if
    the frame format does not match the expected format, assume software
    decoding.  (This was also what the hw-decode.c FFmpeg example did if the
    format did not match the expected format)

    obs-browser: Fix audio cutting out
    
    CEF outputs multiple audio streams at once, and OBS was only able to
    handle one at a time.  This fixes it by using audio lines for each CEF
    audio stream, and mixes them together itself.

commit 73704f20db6061cee6c3c63c07e194bc3f950333
Author: jp9000 <obs.jim@gmail.com>
Date:   Wed Aug 21 14:35:40 2019 -0700

    libobs: Add audio lines
    
    Adds the "audio_line" internal source type as a bare source type for the
    sole purpose of outputting audio, and the obs_source_info::audio_mix
    callback which allows mixing of those audio lines, which is then treated
    as normal audio for the source.  Audio line objects should be added as
    sub-sources when multiple audio lines from a single source are needed,
    then mixed together with the audio_mix callback.
    
    The difference between the new obs_source_info::audio_mix callback and
    obs_source_info::audio_render is that obs_source_info::audio_mix (along
    with the audio_line source) are only one track, and it outputs audio to
    the source automatically via obs_source_output_audio() when the call
    completes.  This allows the mixed audio to be treated like a normal
    source's audio, in that you can filter it, change its volume, or monitor
    it.
    
    This change was necessary because the CEF (used with the browser source)
    outputs multiple audio streams at once to a single browser source, so
    it's the program's responsibility to mix those streams together itself.

    obs-outputs: Add dynamic bitrate to RTMP output
    
    The dynamic bitrate operates based upon estimating the current bitrate
    output, and then adjusting the bitrate on the fly as necessary when
    congestion is detected as a replacement for dropping frames.
    
    This may still need adjustment, as it is difficult to accurately emulate
    real-world frame drop scenarios.  This does not currently drop frames at
    all, and because of that, very high congestion may cause additional
    stream delay to viewers (because data will be buffered), but from
    limited testing, most congestion will not cause that and it can safely
    recover pretty quickly without adding significant delay.

    UI: Add box select to preview
    
    This change adds the ability to box select by clicking and dragging from
    an empty part of the preview.
    
    Shift + Drag add any items in the box to the selection. Alt + Drag will
    remove items in the box from the selection. Ctrl + Drag inverts the
    selected state for items in the box.

    libobs: Fix apply_settings & remove_by_name for groups
    
    'obs_properties_apply_settings' and 'obs_properties_remove_by_name'
    would incorrectly ignore property groups and not call the callbacks
    or remove the property, resulting in quite glitchy UI.
    
    This fix works by splitting the internal logic of ...apply_settings
    into an extra function to call, while keeping the API the same. The
    change to ...remove_by_name is to simply recursively going into the
    group content with the same function call.

    libobs: Separate textures for YUV input
    
    The shaders to unpack YUV information from the same texture were rather
    complicated. Breaking them up into separate textures makes the shaders
    much simpler, and we can remove the PRECISION_OFFSET hack.
    
    Performance also gets a nice boost on Intel for planar textures.

    libobs: Separate textures for YUV output, fix chroma
    
    The shaders to pack YUV information into the same texture were rather
    complicated and suffering precision issues. Breaking them up into
    separate textures makes the shaders much simpler and avoids having to
    compute large integer offsets. Unfortunately, the code to handle
    multiple textures is not as pleasant, but at least the NV12 rendering
    path is no longer separate.
    
    In addition, write chroma samples to "standard" offsets. For I444,
    there's no difference, but I420/NV12 formats now have chroma shifted to
    the left as 4:2:0 is shown in the H.264 specification.
    
    Intel GPA, SetStablePowerState, Intel HD Graphics 530
    
    Expect speed incrase:
    I420: 844 us -> 493 us (254 us + 190 us + 274 us)
    I444: 837 us -> 747 us (258 us + 276 us + 272 us)
    NV12: 450 us -> 368 us (319 us + 168 us)
    
    Expect no change:
    NV12 (HW): 580 (481 us + 166 us) us -> 588 us (468 us + 247 us)
    RGB: 359 us -> 387 us

    libobs: Optimize lanczos shader, remove scaling
    
    Use bilinear filtering to reduce 36 taps to 25 for the regular path.
    This works because the middle weights are always between 0 and 1,
    allowing texture coordinates to be placed strategically to sample
    correct ratios. I'm not sure about the undistort path, so I've left that
    alone.
    
    Also remove scaling added in #526, after which weight normalization is
    unnecessary. If we want to use or invent an algorithm with alternate
    downscaling properties, that's fine, but I don't think we should change
    Lanczos scaling to mean something it's not. The scale implementation was
    also seen not working when applied directly to scene items because of
    assumptions made about the projection matrix.

    UI: Fix param logic of ResetHotkeyState calls
    
    The parameter "inFocus" was being given the opposite of what the name
    implies: it was being set to false when in focus, and true when not in
    focus.  This fixes that confusion.

    libobs: Rework RGB to YUV conversion
    
    RGB to YUV converison was previously baked into every scale shader, but
    this work has been moved to the YUV packing shaders. The scale shaders
    now write RGBA instead. In the case where base and output resolutions
    are identical, the render texture is forwarded directly to the YUV pack
    step, skipping an entire fullscreen pass.

    UI: Add option to warn on stop recording
    
    OBS has an option to warn before stopping a stream, but it doesn't have
    a similar warning for recording. This can result in a recording being
    unintentionally stopped.
    
    Add an option to warn when the "Stop Recording" button is pressed.
    
    Note: While OBS also has an option to warn on stream start, this
    patch purposefully does not add similar warn on recording start option.
    This is because accidentally starting to record isn't risky in the same
    way that accidentally starting to stream is.

    libobs: Improve timing of unbuffered deinterlacing
    
    There are devices like the GV-USB2 that produce frames with smmoth
    timestamps at an uneven pace, which causes OBS to stutter because the
    unbuffered path is designed to aggressively operate on the latest frame.
    
    We can make the unbuffered path work by making two adjustments:
    
    - Don't discard the current frame until it has elapsed.
    - Don't skip frames in the queue until they have elapsed.
    
    The buffered path still has problems with deinterlacing GV-USB2 output,
    but the unbuffered path is better anyway.
    
    Testing:
    
    GV-USB2, Unbuffered: Stuttering is gone!
    GV-USB2, Buffered: No regression (still broken).
    SC-512N1-L/DVI, Unbuffered: No regression (still works).
    SC-512N1-L/DVI, Buffered: No regression (still works).

    It's a waste of GPU time to do two fullscreen passes to render final mix

    - Studio Mode: Program
    
    This does not effect:

    UI: Set default maximum name length to 170 characters
    
    As the names entered into this dialog can be used as part of file names
    (for example, saving a scene collection), allowing long names can result
    in silent data loss where OBS creates the collection and allows the user
    to manipulate it, but it cannot be saved on exit. This is due to the
    MAX_PATH limitation on Windows (260 characters). 170 was chosen to
    accomodate the length of the user app data folder plus some room for
    extensions like .json.tmp.

    libobs: obs-filters: Area upscale shader
    
    Add a separate shader for area upscaling to take advantage of bilinear
    filtering. Iterating over texels is unnecessary in the upscale case
    because a target pixel can only overlap 1 or 2 texels in X and Y
    directions. When only overlapping one texel, adjust UVs to sample texel
    center to avoid filtering.
    
    Also add "base_dimension" uniform to avoid unnecessary division.

    A check has been added to ensure feature is enabled only on platforms

    libobs: Call both get_defaults and get_defaults2
    
    Unlike get_properties, there is not reason to not call get_defaults if it is
    given in addition to get_defaults2. Additonally this fixes the bug with
    'init_encoder' which would only ever call get_defaults, resulting in broken
    encoders if those used get_defaults2.

    Build obs textures based on returned pixmap texture types to ensure

    (wrong on nvidia and maybe amd hardware)
    
    Fix X error checking, now you will get 1 BadAlloc when pixmap allocation
    fails instead "glCopyImageSubData failed" every frame. (occurs on Gnome
    under special circumstances)

    libobs: Implement pausing of outputs
    
    This implements pausing of outputs.  To accomplish this, raw audio/video
    data is halted to the encoders or raw output.  Pausing is as precisely
    timed as possible according to the timing of the obs_output_pause call,
    and audio data will be spliced down to the exact audio sample in
    accordance to that timing at the start/end marks.
    
    Outputs that support this (outputs used for recording) can set the
    OBS_OUTPUT_CAN_PAUSE capability flag.

    libobs: Correct raw output starting audio data
    
    If the audio subsystem was buffered to any extent, the audio of a raw
    output would start off at a negative offset, requiring each raw output
    to implement a "prepare_audio" function (as seen in the FFmpeg output)
    in order to ensure proper synchronization with video.  This did not
    apply to encoded outputs because it was already being performed by the
    obs-encoder code.

    libobs: Buffer-smoothing enhancements
    
    If an audio source does not provide enough data at a steady pace, the
    timestamp update does not happen, and buffering increases until it
    maxes out. To counteract this, update the timestamp anyway.
    
    Another issue for decoupled audio sources is that timing is not
    adjusted for divergence from system time. Making this adjustment is
    better for timing stability.
    
    5+ hours of stable audio without any buffering on my GV-USB2 where it
    used to add 21ms every 5 mintues or so.

    win-dshow: Decouple audio from video
    
    If a device produces video and audio timestamps atdifferent rates,
    this divergence can cause massive buffering on the audio side, leading
    to a capped audio buffer, and total sound loss. This change allows a
    hardcoded list of devices to use the existing decoupling logic. For
    now, only "GV-USB2" has been added.
    
    When combined with another fix, 5+ hours of stable audio without any
    buffering on my GV-USB2 where it used to drop sound completely after
    an hour or so.
    
    Partially fixes https://obsproject.com/mantis/view.php?id=1269

    Code submissions have continually suffered from formatting
    inconsistencies that constantly have to be addressed.  Using
    clang-format simplifies this by making code formatting more consistent,
    and allows automation of the code formatting so that maintainers can
    focus more on the code itself instead of code formatting.

    cmake: Install 'libobs.pc' under the correct 'libdir'
    
    In 'libobs/CMakeLists.txt', use '${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}' instead of
    '${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib', as the latter results into 'libobs.pc'
    being installed under '/lib' when '/lib64' would be more appropriate.
    
    In 'libobs/libobs.pc.in', use '@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LIBDIR@' for
    'libdir', '@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@' for 'includedir',
    and '@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@' for 'prefix'.

    libobs: Full-screen triangle format conversions
    
    The cache coherency of rasterization for full-screen passes is better
    using an oversized triangle that is clipped rather than two triangles.
    Traversal order of rasterization is GPU-specific, but will almost
    certainly be better using an undivided primitive.
    
    A smaller benefit is that quads along the diagonal are not evaluated
    multiple times, but that's minor in comparison.
    
    Redo format shaders to bypass vertex buffer, and input layout. Add
    global shader bool "obs_glsl_compile" to make API-specific decisions,
    i.e. handle upside-down UVs. gl_ortho is not needed for format
    conversion because the vertex shader does not use ViewProj anymore.
    
    This can be applied to more situations, but start small first.
    
    Testbed full screen passes, Intel HD Graphics 530:
    RGBA -> UYVX: 467 -> 439 us, ~6% savings
    UYVX -> uv: 295 -> 239 us, ~19% savings

    If the user gave the source list item a custom color, the "background"

    lock/eye checkboxes to also have that background color added on top of
    the chosen color.  This is fixed by explicitly settings the background
    value to none on the lock/eye checkboxes.

    UI: Fix transition A/B labels on macOS/Linux
    
    Previously, if the video size in OBS was too big, the labels would not
    render on macOS/Linux due to the labels not fitting inside the texture
    in the freetype plugin. This change makes it so that there is a maximum
    size for the label, rather than being solely based on video size.
    
    This change also makes the labels look centered on macOS/Linux, as
    unlike the GDI plugin on Windows, the freetype plugin aligns the bottom
    of the text with the bottom of the source.

    libobs: Pair encoders only when output actually starts
    
    Normally, paired encoders are unpaired when they stop.  However, if the
    pairing occurs before the encoders actually start, and the encoders
    never actually end up starting, they are never unpaired, and that
    pairing stays with them until the next time an output is started up
    again.  That in turn can cause an output that uses one of the encoders
    but not the other to not function correctly, and neither properly
    "start" nor stop because the data is queued continually in the
    interleaved packet array.
    
    For example, let's say there are two outputs, two video encoders, and
    one audio encoder.  This can be reproduced by using advanced output mode
    and making the two outputs use separate video encoders while sharing
    track 1's audio encoder.  If you start up the stream output first and it
    fails to fully connect for whatever reason (bad server, bad stream key,
    etc), then you start up the recording output, the recording output will
    appear to be running, but will not stop when you hit "stop recording".
    It will stay perpetually on "stopping recording" and will get stuck that
    way.  This is because when the streaming output started, the streaming
    output would initially pair video encoder A with audio encoder A before
    the encoders actually fully started up (as the encoders do not fully
    start up until a connection is successfully made), and when the
    recording output starts up after that disconnection, audio encoder A
    will wait for video encoder A rather than video encoder B because that
    pairing was never actually cleared.
    
    So, instead of pairing encoders when the output starts, wait until the
    encoders themselves are being started and then pair the encoders at that
    point in time.  This ensures that the encoders start up and will clear
    their pairing when no longer in use.

    libobs: Fix lockup when an encode call fails
    
    (This commit also modifies the UI, obs-ffmpeg, and obs-output modules)
    
    Fixes a long-time regression where the program would lock up if an
    encode call fails.  Shuts down all outputs associated with the failing
    encoder and displays an error message to the user.
    
    Ideally, it would be best if a more detailed error could be displayed to
    the user about the nature of the error, though the primary problem is
    the encoder errors are typically not something the user would be able to
    understand.  The current message is a bit of a generic error message;
    improvement is welcome.
    
    Another suggestion is to try to have the encoder restart seamlessly,
    though it would take a significant amount of work to be able to make it
    do something like that properly, and it sort of assumes that encoder
    failures are sporadic, which may not necessarily be the case with some
    hardware encoders on some systems.  It may be better just to use another
    encoder in that case.  For now, seamless restart is ruled out.

    libobs: Improve low-resolution bilinear sampling
    
    The issue with the current bilinear_lowres_scale effect is that it
    samples adjacent texels, disregarding the texel-to-pixel ratio. If the
    ratio is large, this can lead to aliasing. This change provides a fair
    set of texture samples across the entire pixel.
    
    The 8-sample pattern used here comes from Direct3D.

    libobs: Fix various alpha issues
    
    There are cases where alpha is multiplied unnecessarily. This change
    attempts to use premultiplied alpha blending for composition.
    
    To keep this change simple, The filter chain will continue to use
    straight alpha. Otherwise, every source would need to modified to output
    premultiplied, and every filter modified for premultiplied input.
    
    "DrawAlphaDivide" shader techniques have been added to convert from
    premultiplied alpha to straight alpha for final output. "DrawMatrix"
    techniques ignore alpha, so they do not appear to need changing.
    
    One remaining issue is that scale effects are set up here to use the
    same shader logic for both scale filters (straight alpha - incorrectly),
    and output composition (premultiplied alpha - correctly). A fix could be
    made to add additional shaders for straight alpha, but the "real" fix
    may be to eliminate the straight alpha path at some point.
    
    For graphics, SrcBlendAlpha and DestBlendAlpha were both ONE, and could
    combine together to form alpha values greater than one. This is not as
    noticeable of a problem for UNORM targets because the channels are
    clamped, but it will likely become a problem in more situations if FLOAT
    targets are used.
    
    This change switches DestBlendAlpha to INVSRCALPHA. The blending
    behavior of stacked transparents is preserved without overflowing the
    alpha channel.
    
    obs-transitions: Use premultiplied alpha blend, and simplify shaders
    because both inputs and outputs use premultiplied alpha now.

    UI: Remove mac browser workarounds, improve stability
    
    The workarounds were made because of conflicts with running multiple UI
    threads at once on macOS, which macOS can't do very well, and would be
    susceptible to crashes.  This would cause crashes not only on startup
    but seemingly at random when using the browser source on macOS.  The
    original "fix" was a hack to try to minimize UI code and browser UI code
    from executing at the same time.  The macOS initial scene loading was
    deferred until all Qt-related and main window initialization was
    completed.  Although this worked to some extent to prevent conflicts, it
    made it so that there was an initial period on startup where the entire
    UI seemed "blank" for users, and it was still possible for the main UI
    thread and the browser UI thread to clash, causing crashes seemingly at
    random for users.
    
    The external message pump method of CEF is the solution to the problem,
    which is the method which allows the main UI thread to share events with
    CEF.  To do this, all CEF operations need to be performed in the UI
    thread (Qt's main thread), and CefDoMessageLoopWork() needs to be called
    when CefApp::OnScheduleMessagePumpWork callback is triggered.  A number
    of other issues had to be solved as well, such as CefBrowser references
    getting "stuck" in the Qt event queue.
    
    With this, macOS no longer needs to do the "deferred load" hack, and
    browsers are now much more stable and no longer as susceptible to
    seemingly random crashes, improving overall program stability when
    browsers are used.

    obs-ffmpeg: Move ffmpeg-mux to executable dir
    
    Instead of having ffmpeg-mux stored in a data directory, install it to
    the primary binary directory.  On windows, this fixes ffmpeg-mux
    potentially accessing the wrong FFmpeg libraries (some programs install
    them to system32, foolishly), and instead ensures that it uses the ones
    that come with the program.  On Linux, ensures that a binary is in its
    appropriate directory (/usr/bin or /usr/local/bin rather than a subset
    of /usr/share or /usr/local/share).

    libobs: Add better default source color range handling
    
    Fixes handling of the `obs_source_frame::full_range` member variable,
    which is often set to false by default by many plugins even when using
    RGB, which would cause RGB to be marked as "partial range".  This change
    is crucial for when partial range RBG support is implemented.
    
    Adds `obs_source_frame2` structure that replaces the `full_range` member
    variable with a `range` variable, which uses the `video_range_type` enum
    to allow handling default range values.  This member variable treats
    VIDEO_RANGE_DEFAULT as full range if the format is RGB, and partial
    range if the format is YUV.
    
    Also adds `obs_source_output_video2` and `obs_source_preload_video2`
    functions which use the `obs_source_frame2` structure instead of the
    `obs_source_frame` structure.
    
    When using the original `obs_source_frame`, `obs_source_output_video`,
    and `obs_source_preload_video` functions, RGB will always be full range
    by default for backward compatibility purposes.

    UI: Change icons to svg
    
    This changes all of the icons from png to svg. With svgs, scaling is
    unlimited. With the svgs, the issue of the @ symbols with the Windows
    updater is no longer an issue.
    
    I changed the colors of the icons to a light gray (#d2d2d2), in the
    dark themes, because I thought they looked better with this color.
    
    The mute, unmute, plus, minus, up, down and expand icons are from the
    Feather Icons set. https://feathericons.com/
    
    The visibility icon is from the Octicons set. https://octicons.github.com/
    
    The locked and unlocked icons are from the Open Iconic set.

    win-wasapi: Fix audio capture after unplugging device
    
    This commit fixes a bug where the user would have to restart OBS when
    certain types of devices are unplugged and plugged back in again
    (particularly USB devices).  A wait interval is required
    (RECONNECT_INTERVAL) because Windows does not send any events to
    IAudioCaptureClient on device invalidation.

    libobs: Add property groups
    
    Property groups allow multiple properties to be combined into a single
    visual group and thus can be used to reduce visual clutter and improve
    user experience by giving additional context to a property. The name of
    a child of a group is not affected by the group and thus all property
    names must still be unique.
    
    A new parent field has been added to obs_properties_t to ease the
    tracking of existing properties. That way properties inside a group will
    also be able to verify that they have a unique name.

Author: James Park <jpark37@gmail.com>

    libobs: Simplify YUV conversion
    
    Currently several shaders need "DrawMatrix" techniques to support the
    possibility that the input texture is a "YUV" format. Also, "DrawMatrix"
    is overloaded for translation in both directions when it is written for
    RGB to "YUV" only.
    
    A cleaner solution is to handle "YUV" to RGB up-front as part of format
    conversion, and ensure only RGB inputs reach the other shaders. This is
    necessary to someday perform correct scale filtering without the cost of
    redundant "YUV" conversions per texture tap.
    
    A necessary prerequisite for this is to add conversion support for
    VIDEO_FORMAT_I444, and that is now in place. There was already a hack in
    place to cover VIDEO_FORMAT_Y800. All other "YUV" formats already have
    conversion functions.
    
    "DrawMatrix" has been removed from shaders that only supported "YUV" to
    RGB conversions. It still exists in shaders that perform RGB to "YUV"
    conversions, and the implementations have been sanitized accordingly.

    UI: Rename Default theme to System
    
    The system theme was named Default even though the default theme is Dark.
    This addresses that by renaming Default.qss to System.qss. I've made it
    backwards compatible so users already using this theme are not affected.
    
    The theme list now shows up as:
    -System
    -Dark (Default)
    -Acri
    -Rachni
    
    I have also made it so that you can specify the default theme in the
    UI config file.

    libobs: Add additional effect debugging information
    
    Adds more log information for effects, such as the reformatted effect code, parameters, techniques and passes. This is useful for tracking down issues and what actually ends up being compiled in the end, without having to guess where the error is actually at, as what is compiled and what was originally there usually differ by a lot.
    
    This information is only logged if libobs is compiled in debug and _DEBUG_SHADERS is defined and not compiled if either of those are not the case.

    D3DPERF is preferred to ID3DUserDefinedAnnotation because it supports
    colors. d3d9.lib is now linked in to support this.
    
    This feature is disabled by default, and is controlled by

    libobs: libobs-d3d11: obs-filters: No excess alpha
    
    Currently SrcBlendAlpha and DestBlendAlpha are both ONE, and can
    combine together to form two. This is not a noticeable problem for
    UNORM targets because the channels are clamped, but it will likely
    become a problem if FLOAT targets are more widely used.
    
    This change switches DestBlendAlpha to INVSRCALPHA, and starts
    backgrounds as opaque black instead of transparent black. The blending
    behavior of stacked transparents is preserved without overflowing the
    alpha channel.

    lead to the parameter being included in the stream key that is saved to
    disk, making it impossible to disable the bandwidth test later on.
    
    By doing this properly and using string concatenation instead of
    modifying (appending to) the key_ value this will no longer happen.

    Fixes the `obs.rc` file appearing in the UI source tree and moves it
    into the out-of-tree build directories provided by CMake. Projects
    requiring this can use it by adding `${obs-studio_BINARY_DIR}/obs.rc`
    to their source list.

    libobs: Fix and simplify Area scale filter

    libobs: Fix and simplify Area scale filter
    
    It appears there's a projection flip that is applied in some situations,
    like the preview pane in studio mode, and the shader math fails when
    it's active causing the output color to be zero. This fixes the math for
    GLSL (with a tiny redundancy penalty to HLSL), and cleans up some
    unnecessary code along the way.
    
    Use abs() to avoid zero area in case the OpenGL projection flip is
    active. Also simplify the math, and remove the unnecessary sampler
    state.

    which returns the pointer to the QSystemTrayIcon cast to void (much like
    the QMainWindow pointer for the main window).

    can't figure out how to get them back, who for whatever reason choose
    not to read the message box when closing dock widgets that tells them
    how to get it back.  The users can still hide the primary dock widgets
    via the View menu, but they can no longer close them via the [x] button
    on the dock widget.  This change does not apply to secondary dock
    widgets, such as a chat window, stats, etc.

    libobs: Fix frame not being cleared
    
    Fixes the remaining case where a frame from the previous
    recording/stream could show up at the beginning of the next
    recording/stream on the same running session when using the new version
    of NVENC.  Textures are being converted for both raw and texture-based
    encoders, so this variable which determines whether a texture is ready
    and has been converted should be cleared in both cases.

    libobs-d3d11: Improve NV12 validity check for AMD
    
    On some AMD systems, the test for bad NV12 output would come up negative
    (output was good), but when recording/streaming, it would have bad
    output.  While the test worked correctly with NVIDIA systems, it did not
    work in these cases.  This was because we did not correctly reproduce
    the exact conditions of green output because the textures used for the
    test were not also keyed mutex shared textures.  This fixes that issue
    and ensures the test works correctly in those other niche cases.

    obs-ffmpeg: Change clear on media end wording for media source
    
    As per mantis issue 1403, the current wording for ClearOnMediaEnd is
    ambiguous. Since it says "Hide source", some may believe it to mean the
    scene item in the sources list will have it's visibility set to hidden.
    This wording makes it clearer what the checkbox actually does.

    Add "Area" scale filter
    
    This new scale filter computes pixels by weighing the coverage area of
    source pixels over the target pixel. This algorithm works well for both
    upsampling and downsampling, but was mainly designed to upscale
    high-quality low-resolution sources like RGB/HDMI retro consoles. I've
    heard of people using odd workarounds like scaling up to very high
    resolutions before scaling back down to preserve pixel shartpness. This
    algorithm directly addresses this use-case in a much more direct
    fashion.
    
    The Area scale filter does a better job of preserving the thickness of
    thin features than the Point filter.
    
    The Area scale filter does not look at source pixels that lie outside
    of the target pixel, leading to a much sharper image than Bilinear,
    Bicubic, and Lanczos filters.
    
    This filter should interpolate pixels in linear space, but OBS is not
    equipped to do that at the moment.
    
    libobs: Add GPU effect, and wire up scene serialization.
    
    obs-filters: Add Area as an option for scale_filter.
    
    UI: Add Area as an option for both scene items, and canvas downscaling.

    When all outputs stop, and then the output starts back up again at a
    later point after that, the last frame data or two from the previous
    output session would end up as the first frame or two of the proceeding
    output.  This was because certain rendering variables were not being
    properly cleared when a new output starts back up.

    from the GPU.  This test on startup determines whether that bug is
    occurring, and if so, disables NV12 texture support.

    libobs: Tell filters that we want to load
    
    Previously only sources would receive a load signal, but sources and
    filters would receive a save signal. This meant that filters that had
    a save signal to store something on disk would never receive a load
    signal to load it from disk.
    
    With this both sources and filters will now receive save and load
    signals, allowing both to work the same way.

    UI: Make workaround for Logitech plugin hard lock
    
    In commit d17ee20863, we attempted to fix a race condition crash in the
    Logitech plugin by deferring the "stream/recording/replay buffer active"
    calls to the UI thread.  However, the Logitech plugin loop_function
    funciton can call obs_frontend_streaming_active/etc functions while the
    UI thread waits for the loop_function thread for many OBS events,
    causing a hard lock in the Logitech plugin.  This fixes that by making
    the obs_frontend_streaming_active/etc functions completely atomic
    instead.  It's a bit of a hack but it's better than accessing objects.

    libobs/media-io: Fix mono upmix
    
    A mono source is currently upmixed by swresampler in the following way:
    - for stereo output, FL=FR=input/sqrt(2)
    - for other speaker layouts of the outputs, FC=input, other channels
    are zeroed.
    
    In the case of stereo output, this leads to a 3dB level decrease which
    users have issue with [1].
    The obvious fix of adding a 3dB gain is reported to be adding distortions
    on some setups [2].
    Note that the "Downmix to Mono" does not fix this upmix problem, since
    it just makes all output channels identical by summing all input channels
    and normalizing (by dividing by the number of output channels). This last
    normalization step results in a level reduction for a mono input.
    
    [1] This fixes https://obsproject.com/mantis/view.php?id=960.

    to know what's going on while waiting for it to connect, but on startup
    it's not really necessary and can be kind of annoying.

    The previous commit in this module meant to defer the properties update
    of the slideshow source, not the image source.  Wrong file was modified.

    libobs-d3d11: Fix rebuild of NV12 textures

    NV12 rebuild functions.

    Adds a texture-based NVENC implementation which passes OBS NV12 output
    textures directly to NVENC without downloading them off of the GPU,

    If NV12 textures are unavailable or the new encoder fails to initialize
    for whatever reason, it will fall back to the FFmpeg NVENC
    implementation safely.

    libobs: Add texture-based encoding support
    
    Allows the ability to encode by passing NV12 textures.  This uses a
    separate thread for texture-based encoders with a small queue of
    textures.  An output texture with a keyed mutex shared texture is locked
    between OBS and each encoder.  A new encoder callback and capability
    flag is used to encode with textures.

    libobs: Split do_encode in to two funcs
    
    This splits the "do_encode" function in to "do_encode" and
    "send_off_encoder_packet", the latter of which allows the ability for
    texture-based encoders to manage their own encoding and just simply send
    off a packet to the outputs.

    libobs/media-io: Add frame funcs for separate GPU thread
    
    Normally, the total and skipped frame count for the encoder is performed
    in the video-io thread.  However, because a new thread is being
    introduced for texture-based encoding, the frontend has no way of being
    able to query that.  So, instead of making the frontend query that data
    separately, just make the texture encoder thread increment the values of
    video-io.  That way, the frontend doesn't need to change any code, and
    can continue using the same functions for determining the total/skipped
    frame count.
    
    This can cause the frame count to be doubled if both a texture-based
    encoder and a raw data encoder is active at the same time, but it's an
    acceptable alternative.

    obs-ffmpeg: Implement NVENC video card blacklist
    
    This implements a blacklist of devices that ship with NVENC libraries,
    but do not support NVENC, which would cause the plugin to mistakenly
    think that NVENC was available when it was not.  If these devices are
    the only NVIDIA devices on the system, consider NVENC unavailable.
    
    This is much more efficient than spawning an encoder on startup to see
    if NVENC is available, which would incur a ~500 millisecond hit on
    startup.  Additionally, also much less crash-prone.

    libobs: Add ability to reroute encoders
    
    Allows the ability for one encoder to defer to another in case of
    failure or unsupported feature.  Okay, fine, it's mostly a hack so the
    new NVENC encoder can fall back to the FFmpeg encoder if NV12 textures
    aren't in use, that way it does not have to implement raw fallback
    support itself.  The settings and properties are pretty much the same,
    so there's no reason not to utilize it in order to save time that could
    otherwise be spent more productively.

    UI: Improve/refactor autoconfig/settings service UI
    
    Makes it so that services can have custom handling on a per-service
    basis.  The bottom part of the service pane is now a stacked widget
    which can now be customized for different types of services
    (particularly OAuth services).

    UI: Only def. BROWSER_AVAILABLE for WIN32 (for now)
    
    Currently, browser panel is only supported on windows.  So rather than
    have to check for _WIN32 in the code everywhere, just move the WIN32
    check to cmake, that way we don't have to have _WIN32 checks in the code
    everywhere the browser panel code is used, and do not have to remove a
    whole bunch of unnecessary _WIN32 #ifdefs for other operating systems
    when browser panel support is added for them.

    UI: Remove "service type" from auto-config stream page
    
    The "Custom" service has been moved, and is now an item called "Custom"
    in the "Services" combo box.  This simplifies the stream page of
    auto-configuration and removes an unnecessary widget.  Overall a minor
    but nice slimline/improvement on user experience.

    frontend-tools: Call modified prop callbacks on script load/reload
    
    This change means that the modified callback for a scripts properties is
    always called when first loaded or on a reload. This behavior matches
    the properties view for sources, where all modified callbacks are called
    when the window opens. This change therefore treats reloading as
    equivalent to reopening.

    Operating systems don't report monitors from 0, so OBS shouldn't

    This does not change monitor count internally.

    Use Premultiplied Alpha for Text and Game Capture (#1578)
    
    The GDI+ based Text Source actually uses Premultiplied Alpha. The edges
    of the fonts are therefore incorrectly blended, causing ugly artifacts
    especially if bright text above a bright background is used. Here's an
    image comparing the new text blending (left) to before (right):
    ![https://i.imgur.com/VhhkQcZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/VhhkQcZ.png)
    
    Additionally, the game capture has the same problem, so premultiplied
    alpha is used there as well now.

    UI: Fix accessibility/narration text on sources list
    
    Fixes the narration reading (for the blind) for items in the sources
    list; previously they would not be read due to the new custom model.
    This issue is solved by returning the name of item in the form of a
    QVariant of a QString returned from the QAbstractItemModel::data virtual
    function when the Qt::AccessibleTextRole role is used.

    obs-ffmpeg: Bind network buffer size in the UI
    
    Input buffer by default is set to 2MB - for some sources, for example streaming
    RTSP input over UDP, this is not enough and causes significant playback issues
    that are not present while playing back the same source under ffplay/mpv.
    
    It looks like someone actually started working on this feature as there are
    translated strings, properties and everything ready - only the control was
    missing from the UI. This commit adds that control.
    
    Currently, the range is set to 1-16MB, step 1MB. This is somewhat arbitrary,
    so suggestions to tweak this range with more real-world use cases are welcome.

    UI: Fix display of mono source with surround output
    
    A mono input with surround output is upmixed by swresampler by routing
    it to FC (front center) by default which corresponds to third channel
    for 3.0, 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 7.1. (The other channels are muted.)
    But the volume meters are set to show the first channel for mono sources.
    Therefore although audio is processed, it would not show on the meter.
    This fixes this display issue.

    libobs: Fix starting timestamp for preloaded frames
    
    If audio monitoring is enabled and set to output only, the
    obs_source_show_preloaded_video function would still incorrectly set the
    current source audio output timestamp to the current system time, which
    would cause audio to use an incorrect starting point from long ago for
    the first starting audio segment if audio monitoring is then turned off
    some time after having started the source.
    
    Instead, the starting timestamp should be set to 0 if audio monitoring
    is enabled with no output to stream, so that if/when audio monitoring is
    disabled, it recalculates the starting timestamp of the first audio
    packet on the spot again.

    rtmp-services: Allow seamless service renaming
    
    Allows the ability for services to specify alternate or old names that
    they used to have in the json service list so they can safely be renamed
    seamlessly and use the proper service settings.  This way, if a user is
    using an older service in their configuration, it can still detect which
    service it's supposed to be using and apply those service-specific
    settings for that user.

    Fixes an issue when it's hard to perform drag-by-mouse move of the

    Info: the handle minimum size styled as 20px, while add/sub-line is
    14px, thus only 6px left for mouse drag when handle resides at corner.
    While handle styled to cover whole bar including, subcontrol elements,
    it is better to remove the hidden subcontrols completely.

    linux-capture: Fix repeated swapping of swapRedBlue and improve robustness further
    
    Previously toggled swapRedBlue every update regardless of settings being set, which resulted in
    moving or resizing of windows causing undesired color-swapping behavior. Also now use more direct
    method of comparing visualIDs without type-casting and base the glxpixmap attributes on texture
    format being used rather than the bit-depth of the window.

    CI: Add mbedTLS dependency for AppVeyor Linux
    
    On Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial), we have to build mbedTLS from source because
    the version available from apt, mbedTLS 2.2.1, does not work with the
    RTMPS implementation in OBS, which requires mbedTLS 2.7 at minimum. This
    is due to the use of the function mbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param_bin, which
    was introduced in mbedTLS 2.7.

    CI: Build on Linux with AppVeyor
    
    Build on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) with AppVeyor. Disable PowerShell on
    Linux. Ubuntu 16.04's dependencies are different from the existing
    Ubuntu 14.04 dependencies, so a separate script for installing those
    dependencies has been added.

    CI: Move AppVeyor install commands to a script file
    
    Move the AppVeyor install scripts to a separate script file. This
    shortens the appveyor.yml file and makes it easier to introduce new
    install scripts for other build environments.
    
    There is one minor change to the install script, and that was to change
    directory back to the obs-studio git root directory.

    Also, the mouse pointer was misaligned to the scroll handle when

    and finishes first.

    Decklink cards accept 2, 8 or 16 audio channels.
    If obs audio output is setup to n channels ( 8 >= n > 2), and the
    decklink card captures n channels, one needs to squash the silent
    channels (n+1, .., 8) or sampling issues occur.
    This had been done on windows but is required also on macOs and linux.
    The commit adds the fix for macOS and linux.
    Some code factoring has also been done.

    UI: Prevent format-truncation compiler warning
    
    Variables path and dir with the same declared size triggers a compiler
    warning about possible truncation. Although, depending on the path
    where profiles are stored, its still possible to go beyong the declared
    size and the path will be invalid. This will not trigger any
    compilation warning and all invalid paths will be cought by the already
    check in the os_glob function.

    This both makes it clearer that its only needed on 32bit system and
    clear the compiler warning.

    UI: Add retina support and updated icons
    
    OBS Studio currently does not support retina rendering for any of the
    images in the app. This adds support for retina pixmap rendering as
    well as adding higher resolution versions of each icon that was not
    a high enough resolution to support 2x. The icons work when switching
    themes and will only render the 2x versions when the device pixel
    ratio is greater than or equal to 2.
    
    I also added credits to the readme for images that were already being
    used that require credit to the author. If the OBS community has
    paid for these images already, I can remove the credits from the
    readme. The credit is for the invisible, visible, and gear icons.

    The previous model stored a new FBO per texture width/height/format on
    a array in the device struct. This allocated memory was only released
    on gs_device_destroy (obs exit).
    
    The new approach stores a FBO on gs_texture and the its info is
    destroyed once the texture is deleted.

    UI: Fix macOS bug (scrollbar blocking lock icons)
    
    Normally on macOS, scrollbars are supposed to appear/disappear as you
    scroll, but they would be on top of the content you're scrolling.
    However, Qt has a bug where if you apply a custom theme to scroll bars,
    they no longer disappear.  This causes things under the scrollbar (such
    as the lock icons in the sources list) to disappear under the scrollbar,
    because macOS normally expects those scrollbars to face out.  This fixes
    that issue by adding a space to the end of the sources list box items to
    allow space for the scrollbar.

    libobs: Blacklist old obs-browser version on macOS
    
    On macOS, the older version of the browser plugin used to reside in a
    different directory.  This would cause two versions of obs-browser to
    load if you installed the new version of OBS over the old version of
    OBS.  This fixes that bug with an slightly unsightly hack by
    blacklisting that older module if it tries to load an obs-module that
    resides in that specific older directory.

    UI: Fix snapping of group sub-items
    
    Sub-items would incorrectly calculate as having bounds of {0,0} - {0,0}
    because it did not enumerate group sub-items, so group sub-items would
    not snap correctly.  This fixes group sub-item snapping so that bounds
    of group sub-items are calculated, transformed by their group, and added
    to the snapping boundary.  Bounds of group sub-items will now snap as
    though they were normal items.

    UI: Fix bug grabbing handles of group sub-items
    
    When a group's transform was scaled down, that scale would not apply to
    grabbing the handles of sub-items, so the "handle radius" would
    incorrectly be miscalculated (the handle radius calculation for the
    sub-item would be scaled down by the parent's scaling, making it too
    small to grab).  Instead of calculating relative to the current parent,
    this fixes the issue by operating in screen space at all times.

    libobs: Fix applying group transform of flipped sources
    
    Fixes a bug where sources that are flipped vertically and/or
    horizontally would not maintain their flipped state.

    UI: Allow resetting transform of group sub-items

    rtmp-services: Do not check for valid URL if using "auto"
    
    "Auto" is sort of a special use-case for certain services
    (Twitch/Mixer), and the code recently added in be8ddc06a would
    unintentionally override it.  This would for example cause the "Auto"
    setting on Twitch to set the user to use an Asia server unintentionally
    because "auto" is not in the json file.

    libobs: Initialize hotkey pair ID variable properly
    
    The value of 0 can represent a valid hotkey ID, so make sure that when
    we initialize a hotkey variable, that we use OBS_INVALID_HOTKEY_ID or
    OBS_INVALID_HOTKEY_PAIR_ID and not 0.
    
    This fixes a bug where scene item hotkey pair IDs would be initialized
    to 0, and it would unregister valid unrelated hotkeys.  Particularly,
    the start/stop streaming hotkey pair ID, which would commonly be the
    first hotkey pair created, thus having the hotkey pair ID of 0.  The
    start/streaming hotkey pair would unintentionally be unregistered via
    code in obs-scene.c.

    UI: If users renames a source, only revert on Esc
    
    Fixes a design flaw where if renaming a source, the source's name would
    revert if you de-focused (clicked away) from the rename edit widget.
    Instead, the functionality for revert should really only just be when
    the user presses the Escape key.

    cmake: Prevent policy CMP0072 warning
    
    This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.11.
    
    The FindOpenGL module provides an OpenGL::GL target and an
    OPENGL_LIBRARIES variable for projects to use for legacy GL interfaces.
    When both a legacy GL library (e.g. libGL.so) and GLVND libraries for
    OpenGL and GLX (e.g. libOpenGL.so and libGLX.so) are available, the
    module must choose between them. It documents an OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE
    variable that can be used to specify an explicit preference. When no
    such preference is set, the module must choose a default preference.
    
    The default behavior is to default to legacy (OLD) and is deprecated.

    rtmp-services: Ensure set URL exists within server list
    
    If the user had a valid service selected, but the server that the user
    originally was using is now (for whatever reason) no longer listed, the
    rtmp-common service would still use that server rather than any of the
    newer servers, and the user would have to physically go in to their
    settings to reconfigure to get it to use that new server.
    
    Instead, make sure that the server the user has selected exists within
    the server list, and if it doesn't, use the first server in the list
    instead by default.

    obs-outputs: Add support for and use mbedTLS for SSL
    
    This diff adds mbedTLS support to the obs-outputs plugin.  PolarSSL and
    mbedTLS have grown so different between 2015-or-so when libRTMP was
    written, and now it's no longer feasible to just use the USE_POLARSSL
    flag.
    
    This commit adds a WITH_RTMPS tri-state CMake variable (auto/on/off),
    set to "Auto" by default.  "Auto" will use RTMPS if mbedTLS is found,
    otherwise will disable RTMPS.  "On" will make it require mbedTLS,
    otherwise fails configuration, and "Off" disables RTMPS support
    altogether.

    libobs: When ungrouping groups, duplicate items
    
    Because groups can now be used in multiple scenes at once, it's
    important that if the user wishes to ungroup a group, that they must be
    able to keep the group intact if it exists in other scenes.  This
    requires duplicating all scene items (as well as their hotkey/private
    data) instead of just reparenting the subitems.
    
    This fixes an issue where if the user had the group referenced in
    multiple scenes, the group would become empty in other scenes.

    UI: Add Color Coding to Source Tree Widget
    
    This commit adds the ability to select a background color for a
    scene-item, whether it's a custom color or one of eight presets.
    
    As this is an initial implementation, it lacks theme customizability,
    and it also lacks the ability for the user to set their own preset
    colors, so only the hard-coded 8 are available.

    UI: Use QScopedPointer (not QPointer) where applicable
    
    Contrary to what the name would have you believe, QPointer<> is not used
    to delete a pointer when it leaves its specific scope.  Instead, it's
    used to check to see if the pointer is still valid.  For most
    QWidget-based objects, this is actually fine because QWidgets that are
    assigned to layouts or other widgets will automatically be destroyed --
    however, for non-widget objects, this can cause a memory leak.
    
    This patch replaces QPointer with QScopedPointer where applicable to
    prevent memory leaks.

    other's data structures and resulted in crashes.

    libobs: Always try to update transform in current thread
    
    Due to the recent change in which scene items now only update their
    transforms during the next frame's tick, snapping sources would
    sometimes jitter and have incorrect snapping.  This fixes that issue by
    reverting to the behavior of updating the transform immediately rather
    than deferring the update to the next frame tick, but only on non-group
    items.
    
    This should not be done on items that are sub-items of groups because we
    rely on the obs_scene_item::update_transform variable to update the
    parent group's transform in addition.

    As of commit 2eb5a22, CoreAudio devices that use one device handle for

    Tested with the built-in output, a Magewell XI100DUSB-HDMI which is
    input only, and a MOTU UltraLite audio interface, which shows as
    output/input capable.

    libobs: Defer update of scene item texture
    
    If the scene item crop/filtering is updated, instead of
    creating/destroying the item texture on the spot, update it in the
    graphics thread to prevent potential race conditions (especially when
    the crop function for example could be called from within
    obs_scene_enum_items in some situations, which would lock the graphics
    and scene mutexes in the wrong order).

    UI: Allow alt-cropping on bounding box scene items
    
    Allows the use of alt-cropping on scene items that have bounding box
    enabled.  The crop will simply apply to the source within the bounding
    box rather than try to do anything fancy.  A simple solution to an
    annoying problem.

    obs-qsv:  Allow for multiple QSV encoders
    
    Allow multiple QSV encoders, usefull for live + recorded parallel
    sessions.  The first QSV encoder will create a DirectX device and return
    a handle / pointer.  Any additional QSV encoder will use that same
    pointer to the DirectX device.  We keep track of the number of open
    QSV encoders so that we wait to close the DirectX resources after all
    encoders are closed.

    libobs: Change groups to actual public types
    
    (This commit also modifies UI)
    
    Changes groups to their own independent type, "group".  This allows them
    to be used like other regular types, and allows the ability to reference
    groups in multiple scenes.  Before, a group would always be linked to
    the scene it was in.  This made it cumbersome for users to modify groups
    if they had a similar group in multiple scenes (they would have to
    modify each group in each scene).  Making groups like other source types
    makes more sense to solve this issue so they can be referenced in
    multiple scenes at once.  This also removes a significant amount of
    group-specific handling code required for implementing groups in the
    front-end.
    
    One limitation however: due to the way sub-items of groups are
    seamlessly modifiable and sortable as part of the whole scene, the user
    cannot have multiple references to the same group within one scene.

    groups so that a group is not inherently tied to a specific scene, and
    helps allow a single group to be referenced in multiple scenes if
    desired.

    As of version 3, libvlc on macOS is linked against libvlccore

    libvlccore. Explicitly load libvlccore so that the symbols that
    libvlc needs can be found.

    UI: Fix bug where color property shows transparency
    
    Technically, setting the transparency value via a color property isn't
    currently supported.  However, some sources/filters will set their alpha
    portion of their color value to 0, which would cause the color property
    to have a transparent background.  Set the alpha value to 255 for now,
    at least until we properly implement support for setting transparency
    via the color property (if we ever do).

    UI: Fix display bug with color property
    
    With the recent change to fix showing color in the color property widget
    when using different themes (b8f03791ea7), a bug was introduced:  when
    opening filters with a filter that has a color property, it would sort
    of "bug out" and recreate over and over.  This is likely due to
    something internally with Qt and the stacked layout.  The stacked layout
    really is not necessary, so remove the stacked layout and just use the
    color label directly.

    UI: Fix mixer dock widget minSize being too big
    
    When the vertical volume meter was introduced it set in the OBSBasic.ui
    mixer dock definition a min width/height that was valid for both
    widgets. QStackedWidget hints the minimum size as the higher w/h
    of its children so this workaround is necessary.

    obs-transitions: Fix potential stinger divide by 0
    
    If the transition point was above or equal to 1.0, it would cause a
    divide by 0 error a few lines down.  This could cause audio data to
    become corrupted with NAN audio data when mixing, which can cause
    certain audio encoders (namely the FFmpeg AAC encoder) to fail.
    
    It was possible for the transition point to be above or equal to 1.0 if
    the stinger media file was no longer loadable for whatever reason.

    libobs: Fix compilation issue on case-sensitive filesystems
    
    When using a macOS running on a case-sensitive filesystem, the project
    build fails due to AudioToolBox/AudioQueue.h not being found.
    The correct path is AudioToolbox/AudioQueue.h. Since macOS comes with a
    case-insensitive filesystem by default, this is a rare ocurrence
    among developers who change it to be case-sensitive.

    obs-x264: Specify x264 color space for BT.601
    
    Back in an older commit, the default YUV colorspace was changed to 601
    in order to ensure correct playback in video players that ignore the
    contents of the H264 header.
    x264's "undef" is unfortunately not what players that don't ignore the
    header expect for BT.601, resulting in incorrect colors when played
    back. Setting it to "bt470bg", similar to what is specified in ffmpeg
    outputs, remedies this issue.

    libobs/callback: Add signal reference counting
    
    Adds a simple signal reference counting function
    (signal_handler_connect_ref) that makes it so that signals keep the
    handler around until the all the signal itself is disconnected.  This
    prevents potential crashes where a signal might try to disconnect after
    a handler has already been destroyed (typically in C++ with
    OBSSignalHandler helper objects, where destruction isn't guaranteed to
    be predictable).
    
    This also modifies OBSSignalHandler to use the reference-counting
    connections.

    UI: Add new Multiview Layout for up to 24 scenes
    
    The variable name changes were done with the intent to ease the
    abstraction of the scene, preview and program width/height size
    so its not related with the canvas size but directly related with
    our concept of scenes.

    UI: Add proper source markers to multiview
    
    This ensures the pixel correctness of the sources selection highlight
    boxes when on a fullscreen projector.
    
    When on a windowed projector due to the nature of int<->float
    conversions and also due to the limited space, some source boxes
    might be like 'off-by-one' and barely noticeable.

    so that string values were converted to int. In order to prevent past

    convert that to int on obs init.
    
    This will make the code easier to maintain in clearer to read the
    multiview layout settings, also, makes the addition of new layouts
    easier.

    win-dshow: Allow synchronous create/update
    
    Allows the ability to (optionally) synchronously create/update a
    directshow device source rather than always asynchronously update the
    device.  This is useful if creating/destroying scenes/sources very
    quickly, and helps minimize the risk of creating new directshow sources
    that use the same device, yet may not activate because an existing
    source may already exist.  To use, set "synchronous_activate" to true in
    its settings when updating or creating.  Note that this setting will be
    erased after it's used, and will not be saved to user settings, so it
    must be set each time in order to be used.

    UI: Don't defer load on non-macOS systems
    
    Deferred load is used specifically for macOS systems to ensure that Qt
    and CEF do not load at the same time.  This causes a slight bit of a
    delay in loading the scene after the UI has loaded.  This is not
    necessary for other operating systems, so revert to the older load code
    in the case of different systems.

    libobs, UI: Add true peak measurements
    
    Add a new algorithm to calculate the true-peak. It implements the
    Whittaker- Shannon interpolation from four samples to create 4
    intermediate samples (5 x oversampling) inbetween the middle two
    samples.
    
    With 4 samples and 4 intermediate samples the algorithm can be
    implemented as a 4x4 vector-matrix cross product, which is ideal for
    SSE.
    
    I've also replaced the sample-peak algorithm using SSE as well to
    improve performance.

    obs-ffmpeg: fill in more fields on audio frames
    
    After you call av_frame_alloc(), ffmpeg expects you to fill in certain
    fields on the frame, depending on whether it's an audio or video frame.
    obs-ffmpeg did this in the two places where it allocates video frames,
    but not where it allocates audio frames.  On my system, using trunk
    ffmpeg and the Opus codec, this causes OBS to crash while calling
    avcodec_send_frame, ultimately because av_frame_copy fails due to
    'dst->format < 0' (as 'format' stays at the default of -1), causing a
    null pointer to be added to a buffer queue, which later gets
    dereferenced.
    
    Oddly, the fields in question can just be copied directly from
    corresponding fields in the AVCodecContext, but I don't see any ffmpeg
    API to automatically copy all relevant fields, and all the examples I've
    seen do it by hand.  So this patch does the same.

    point to where no one wants to touch the plugin or contribute to it.

    UI: Add Help -> Crash Reports submenu
    
    Adds the ability to upload crash reports, making it easier for users to

    time permits.

    UI: Specify whether crash/profiler/logs have prefix
    
    Adds a "has_prefix" parameter to delete_oldest_file and get_last_log in
    order to determine whether the file has a prefix when parsing its
    timestamp.  For example, crash logs are prefixed with "Crash", and thus
    it was unable to get the timestamp because it couldn't parse the
    filename correctly due to that fact.

    mac-vth264: Fix video info set logic
    
    In the vt_h264_video_info function, the format of the video to be encoded is
    always being set to VIDEO_FORMAT_NV12, dispite the presence of code to set
    the video format to VIDEO_FORMAT_I420 or VIDEO_FORMAT_I444. This commit fixes
    that function to respect the video format choice of the user.
    
    In addition, whilst testing this fix initially, I also discovered that the
    4:4:4 colour format is not supported by the VideoToolbox H264 encoder.
    Looking at the VideoToolbox code in ffmpeg as a reference, the ffmpeg code
    errors out if a color format other than NV12 or I420 is set. Therefore, this
    commit also logs a warning about I444 not being supported, and uses the NV12
    default.

    mac-vth264: Set the fullrange variable before calling vt_h264_video_info
    
    The fullrange variable is used to set appropriate video format information in
    vt_h264_video_info. Set fullrange first so the video format data is correct in
    all cases.

    The cutoff hack was added many, many years ago as recommended by

    this hack should no longer be necessary.

    win-mf: Deprecate plugin
    
    The windows media foundation H264 encoders have been deprecated for over
    a year, and microsoft's media foundation AAC encoder has had a continued
    issue with occasional random audio glitches.  The FFmpeg AAC encoder has
    had recent development, and is more than sufficient to be able to handle
    the task of encoding in terms of both quality and performance, so it's
    better just to use the FFmpeg encoder from here on out.
    
    As this plugin is no longer needed, for the next year or two it'll still
    be compiled and included, but as a blank plugin that does nothing.  The
    reason why it's still being included as a blank no-operation plugin is
    to overwrite older versions of the plugin.  That way if a user installs
    a newer OBS version over an older one, it won't load up the older win-mf
    plugin where the encoders still were enabled.
    
    This also fixes some rarely reported media foundation crashes that can
    happen on startup.

    libobs/media-io: Change speaker layout to match FFmpeg aac.
    
    (This commit also modifies the obs-ffmpeg module)
    
    The default channel layouts from aac spec are implemented in FFmpeg
    native aac encoder as follows:
    
        AV_CH_LAYOUT_MONO,
        AV_CH_LAYOUT_STEREO,
        AV_CH_LAYOUT_SURROUND,
        AV_CH_LAYOUT_4POINT0,
        AV_CH_LAYOUT_5POINT0_BACK,
        AV_CH_LAYOUT_5POINT1_BACK,
        AV_CH_LAYOUT_7POINT1,
    
    The correspondence of speaker layouts to AV_CH_LAYOUT from FFmpeg is
    changed to reflect the previous table.
    
    Although FFmpeg native aac encoder can now encode all the layouts listed
    in avutil channel_layout.h (on master), there might be issues with older
    FFmpeg binaries.
    
    Note that 2.1 speaker layout will be encoded as AV_CH_LAYOUT_SURROUND
    (FL FR FC) because it is not listed as the default layout for three
    channels.
    
    This just means some optimizations for LFE channel will not be used by
    the encoder which will treat it as an SCE (single channel element).

    UI: Allow nested docks
    
    This change enables the ability to use nested docks, with the dependency of Qt5.10 or later being used to build OBS.
    
    Similar to the Lock UI option we could add a toggle to the menu. Not sure if this is necessary, maybe you guys have some ideas.
    
    Example screenshots of nesting OBS:

    The reason this code is being reverted/removed is because this code is a
    risk to startup stability.  This check will be added again in the
    future, however this code needs to be executed from a secondary piped
    process instead of directly in the process to reduce risk of
    driver/hardware issues impacting program startup.  The same needs to be
    accomplished for the AMF plugin as well.

    frontend-tools: Make instant replay script also save replay
    
    With the "instant-replay.lua" script, it would only play the last replay
    buffer saved, meaning the user would have to save a replay with the
    replay buffer hotkey, and then press the "Play Last Replay" hotkey to
    play the last replay buffer.
    
    Instead, combine the two and make the script save the replay
    automatically first, and then play it back as soon as it's available.
    This makes it actually qualify as an "instant replay" script, as its
    name implies.

    on the source.  Instead, just bypass the filter to ensure that the
    source continues to render.

    libobs: Optimize clearing of unused source audio mixes
    
    Prevents calling memset on mixes that aren't currently active.

    libobs: Fix audio buffer clear in custom source mixing
    
    The memset in custom_audio_render() did not clear all audio buffers when
    the number of output channels was less then 8.  This caused wrong audio
    output on mixes that did not get cleared.

    UI: Put clip detection back in to volume meter
    
    Before the new volume meters were implemented, the meter would flash red
    if the audio was clipping.  This functionality was removed when the
    meters were changed, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and this
    patch puts that functionality back in.  If clipping occurs, the meters
    will be fully colored with the foregroundErrorColor value while the
    clipping is occurring.

    test/test-input: Add audio buffering sync test source
    
    Adds a source which tests whether audio buffering affects audio sync.
    This sync test cycles through 7 audio/video frequencies at 250
    millisecond intervals, and via a hotkey, will artificially move audio
    time back by one second (and the audio cycle back by 4 frequencies).
    This will artificially increase audio buffering by approximately 750
    milliseconds.
    
    Results from this test as of this writing: this test proves that dynamic
    audio buffering does not affect sync.

    Reverting this commit because it had some negative side effects, such as
    adding 500 milliseconds to the startup time.  NVENC detection should
    really be done through its proper API, and not via creating an encoder
    on startup.

    libobs: Fix audio issue with scene items
    
    When a scene is added as a scene item with the same audio sources that
    are already in the current scene, it would cause the current scene to no
    longer output audio due to audio.
    
    To replicate the issue, you would create two separate audio device
    captures in scene 1, use add existing in scene 2 and add one of those
    audio sources, then go back to scene 1, add scene 2 as a source, then
    make scene 1 invisible.

    linux-pulseaudio: Default sample format float32le
    
    This pull request changes the fallback sample format for pulse-audio
    to from PA_SAMPLE_S16LE to PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE.
    
    The pulseaudio plugin can handle the following sample format:
    * PA_SAMPlE_U8
    * PA_SAMPLE_S16LE
    * PA_SAMPLE_S32LE
    * PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE
    
    When an audio device advertises itself as another format, the pulseaudio-plugin
    will ask pulse audio to convert to the fallback sample format.
    
    The fallback PA_SAMPLE_S16LE is not ideal when your audio interface advertises
    as PA_SAMPLE_S24LE since the conversion will lose precision.
    With PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE there is no precision loss and it is also equals OBS's
    internal format.

    mac-capture: Update fix for Soundflower
    
    Some audio devices do not have a fixed number of channels.  For example,
    Soundflower.  This was previously fixed by defaulting the speaker layout
    to stereo.  With surround sound support, the default has been changed to
    the output speaker layout as set in Settings > Audio.

    decklink: Add 2.1 & 4.1 surround layouts
    
    The list of channel layouts available for decklink input is missing 2.1
    & 4.1 layouts.  The commit adds them.  This aligns the decklink input
    with the speaker layouts available at outputs.  Having different layouts
    as input and output invokes FFmpeg resampler, which remixes the channels
    in non trivial way except when downmixing to stereo.  This patch allows
    to avoid such uncontrolled remix of channels with decklink input.

    coreaudio-encoder: Surround sound improvements
    
    The core audio aac encoder has bitrates maps specific to speaker
    layouts.  Previously, the bitrate map maxed at 320 kbs and was the map
    for stereo.  The bitrate map is now tailored to the speaker layout.  In
    practice this unlocks higher bitrates.  For instance up to 960 kbs for
    7.1.  Additionally the commit fixes a bug with 2.1 with channels not
    ordered correctly.

    channel layouts.

    UI: Rework volume-meters, adding more information
    
    The following features have been added to the audio-meters:
     * Stereo PPM-level meter, with 40 dB/1.7s decay rate.
     * Stereo VU-level meter, with 300 ms integration time.
     * Stereo Peak-hold meter, with 20 second sustain.
     * Input peak level color-squares in front of every meter.
     * Minor-ticks for each dB.
     * Major-ticks for every 5 dB.
     * Meter is divided in sections at -20 dB and -9 dB.
    
    The ballistic parameters chosen here where taken from:
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_programme_meter (SMPTE RP.0155)
     * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_meter
    
    In the rework I have removed any ballistic calculations from
    libobs/obs-audio-controls.c making the calculations here a lot more
    simple doing only MAX and RMS calculations for only the samples in
    the current update. The actual ballistics are now done by just
    the UI/volume-control.cpp because ballistics need to be updated
    based on the repaint-rate of the user-interface.
    
    The dB to pixel conversion has been moved from
    libobs/obs-audio-controls.c to UI/volume-control.cpp as well to reduce
    coupling between these two objects, especially when implementing the
    major- and minor-ticks and the sections.
    
    All colors and ballistic parameters are adjustable via QT style sheets.
    There are slight differences in colors for each of the themes.

    libobs/util: Ignore PRINTFATTR if using SWIG preprocessor
    
    SWIG will fail because it doesn't define _MSC_VER and because it doesn't
    know what to do with things like __attribute__.

    libobs/util: Optimize strlist_* functions
    
    When splitting a string in to a string list via stringlist_split, it
    would previously allocate memory for each sub-string and again for the
    list itself.  This optimizes that function to use a single contiguous
    chunk of memory for the sake of access optimization and memory
    allocation efficiency.

    libobs: Add obs_render_main_texture
    
    (Note: This commit also modifies UI and test)
    
    This makes it so that main preview panes are rendered with the main
    output texture rather than re-rendering the main view.  The view will
    render all objects again, whereas the output texture will be a single
    texture render of the same exact thing.
    
    Also fixes some abnormal artifacting when scaling the main preview pane.

    UI: Fix minor Rachni theme bugs
    
    The tab bars in the Rachni theme had an issue related to an attempted
    property of qproperty-drawBase: 0 in the .qss file. This, in theory,
    should have worked and removed the base of the tab bar, but there is a
    bug that prevents this from consistently applying, as detailed here:
    https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-2982
    
    This fix removes that property, and adjusts the styling of the tabs
    themselves for a more consistent experience. Tabs should no longer be
    cut off or displayed improperly.
    
    In addition, this also corrects an issue with the scene/source rename
    QLineEdit field displaying improperly.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix ffmpeg output recording in x264
    
    Fixes ticket 1070.
    See also
    https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/ffmpeg-recording.77378/#post-330473
    (related bugs).
    The ffmpeg constant AVFMT_RAWPICTURE was deprecated in october 2015
    and marked for removal at avformat major bump to version 58
    (ffmpeg commit 34ed5c2 , oct 12, 2015).
    The bump occured with commit 69b5ce6 (oct21, 2017).
    The constant was subsequently removed (commit 693a11b, oct 26 2017).
    It was removed from obs-studio with commit d670d7b (from me).
    But the code block which was executed with this constant was not
    removed, causing issues with ffmpeg output.
    The commit fixes the issue for old ffmpeg builds as well as new ones.
    The constant is reintegrated for avformat major version < 58 and removed
    for version >= 58 (along with its accompanying code).
    Thanks to J Lowe for help in solving the bug.
    (tested on win 10, macos 10.13, ubuntu 17.10 with ffmpeg head & ffmpeg
    3.4.1)

    win-capture: Fix memory capture crash on new capture
    
    If the target process re-creates its D3D context, the game capture tick
    can trigger before the capture is setup, in which case OBS gets a
    CAPTURE_RETRY message. However with the memory capture method, it
    continues to try and copy from the shared memory pointer which is no
    longer valid, resulting in a crash. The fix uses the old texture until
    the next tick at which point the new capture should be ready for use.

    Code Changes:
    - Removed flag BUILD_AMF_ENCODER.
    - AMF SDK is now a submodule of the plugin, no longer requiring extra steps.
    
    Plugin Changes:
    - 'Bitrate.Target' has been renamed to 'bitrate' internally, improving support for "New Networking Code" and "Replay Buffer" which incorrectly rely on this value instead of taking the average bitrate of packets sent over the last second.
    - Drivers with a runtime older than 1.4.6.0 are blacklisted now.
    - All hidden and experimental options have been removed.

    the OBS structs have been renamed.

    This reverts commit de32d89fc6ac1cc85346732f722fe74ac1cb1eca.
    
    Fixes an issue where Linux CI builds fail because FFmpeg fails to
    compile. Using FFmpeg git master in CI builds was obviously not the
    smartest idea because changes in FFmpeg can break things unexpectedly.
    Sorry about that.
    
    The reason for the original commit was that OBS failed to compile
    with FFmpeg 2.4. That has been fixed since.

    Common multi-channel setup is 5.1 and 7.1 with rear speakers.
    
    Thus only setups that include SPEAKER_SIDE_LEFT and SPEAKER_SIDE_RIGHT
    needs the marking as not common (or "side" use), while it stays the
    true Side setup (with side speakers) by its internal meaning.
    
    This "side" is named "surround" by Microsoft. To not confuse users and
    translators, it is wise to use "Side" mark next to format name.

    CI: Fix macOS builds on Travis CI's Xcode 8.3 image
    
    The Travis CI Xcode 8.3 image uses macOS 10.12, where some OS and Xcode
    components were changed. This commit should hopefully fix macOS
    deployments on Travis for Xcode 8.3.

    UI: Add Multiview projector
    
    Jim note:
    
    - Refactored code significantly
    - Added a context menu option to exclude specific scenes from projectors
    - Made it so multiview projectors update when scenes are
      added/removed/renamed
    - Increased text quality
    - Removed the color sources and replaced them with simple solid
      rectangles
    - Increased the border size of "program" and "preview" scenes in the
      lower scene list

    win-dshow: Improve automatic Elgato audio device selection
    
    Implement automatic audio device selection for devices that use two
    separate DirectShow filters for audio and video instead of having a
    single filter with audio and video output pins.
    
    Please note that this fix is currently only active for Elgato USB and
    PCIe devices (e.g. Cam Link, HD60 S, HD60 Pro, 4K60 Pro) to avoid
    unintentionally changing the behavior for any other devices (e.g.
    webcams).
    
    (Jim edit: This fixes an issue with newer Elgato devices where the
    devices would not automatically have their audio coupled with the video;
    users would have to manually select the audio device in order to get
    audio functioning.)

    libobs: Add surround sound audio support
    
    (This commit also modifies the following modules: UI,
    deps/media-playback, coreaudio-encoder, decklink, linux-alsa,
    linux-pulseaudio, mac-capture, obs-ffmpeg, obs-filters, obs-libfdk,
    obs-outputs, win-dshow, and win-wasapi)
    
    Adds surround sound audio support to the core, core plugins, and user
    interface.
    
    Compatible streaming services: Twitch, FB 360 live
    Compatible protocols: rtmp / mpeg-ts tcp udp
    Compatible file formats: mkv mp4 ts  (others untested)
    Compatible codecs: ffmpeg aac, fdk_aac, CoreAudio aac,
                       opus, vorbis, pcm (others untested).
    Tested streaming servers: wowza, nginx
             HLS, mpeg-dash : surround passthrough
    Html5 players tested with live surround:
             videojs, mediaelement, viblast (hls+dash), hls.js
    Decklink: on win32, swap channels order for 5.1 7.1
             (due to different channel mapping on wav, mpeg, ffmpeg)
    Audio filters: surround working.
    Monitoring: surround working (win macOs linux (pulse-audio)).
    VST:     stereo plugins keep in general only the first two channels.
             surround plugins should work (e.g. mcfx does).
    OS: win, macOs, linux (alsa, pulse-audio).
    Misc: larger audio bitrates unlocked to accommodate more channels
    NB: mf-aac only supports mono and stereo + 5.1 on win 10
             (not implemented due to lack of usefulness)

    obs-outputs: Only set stop events if still active
    
    The new code in 3032535f56 would signal that the output has stopped to
    the back-end and front-end, but the event used in the outputs themselves
    to shut down the send thread would still be signaled, causing the next
    connection to immediately stop as soon as it had started.  This fixes it
    so that the event does not get signaled unless the thread is active.

    decklink: Use unbuffered by default, and decouple
    
    Use unbuffered async mode by default, and when in unbuffered mode,
    decouple audio/video so that audio plays as soon as it's received.
    
    This is a workaround for decklink device drivers having unreliable
    video/audio timestamps (audio/video sync drifting over time).  From
    testing, it seems that the handling of video and audio is completely
    separate in the driver; along with the timestamp calculations.  For
    example, when the thread of the decklink audio callback is stalled, it
    would cause the timestamps of the audio alone to go out of sync, which
    indicates timestamps are calculated more or less on the spot independent
    of what video is doing (which is how we replicated the issue fixed by
    b63e4b055e68a).  Because decklink drivers treats the audio and video as
    essentially decoupled, we must also treat it as decoupled.  This is what
    was causing video/audio to drift out of sync over time.

    libobs: Add async video/audio decoupling functions
    
    Decoupling the audio from the video causes the audio to be played right
    when it's received rather than attempt to sync up to the video frames.
    This is useful with certain async sources/devices when the audio/video
    timestamps are not reliable.
    
    Naturally because it plays audio right when it's received, this should
    only be used when the async source is operating in unbuffered mode,
    otherwise the video frame timing will be out of sync by the amount of
    buffering the video currently has.

    rtmp-services: Only update Twitch ingests when necessary

    Instead of pinging Twitch every time the program starts up, only pings
    for new servers when the ingests are actually being used, and when the
    UI uses the auto-configuration dialog.
    
    If ingests have not been cached when using the "Auto" server, it will
    wait for 3 seconds max to query the Twitch ingest API.  If it takes
    longer than 3 seconds or fails, it will defer to SF.  If ingests were
    already cached, then it will use the existing cache immediately.

    win-dshow: Fix video playback when default format is MJPEG
    
    Video playback doesn't work if the default format is MJPEG and there are
    other formats to use; this is because the useDefaultConfig variable is
    still set to true, which overrides the format value that would normally
    tell it to convert to RGB.

    libobs/media-io: Fix decompress_420 function
    
    This function had a number of bugs and just wasn't working properly at
    all.  This function is currently not used in public builds because GPU
    is used for color conversion instead (hence why it had probably not
    really been tested), but a need came up where CPU conversion was useful
    for the sake of testing something else in the back-end, and it needed to
    be fixed before CPU conversion could be used.

    test: Add sync tests
    
    The async source sync test verifies that async sources are playing back
    in sync properly, and the "sync pair (video)" and "sync pair (audio)"
    sources test the back-end syncing down to the exact sample via inserting
    audio data directly in to the back-end with system timestamps.
    
    For these sources, when the video is white, a C sinewave should be
    playing, and when the video is black audio is mute.

    win-wasapi: Subtract frame duration from timestamp
    
    It would appear that the timestamp values returned by devices are not
    perfectly accurate, and in some cases may be calculated on the spot --
    to combat that, it's best to subtract the audio segment's duration from
    the current audio segment's timestamp to ensure the timing is as
    accurate as possible.

    libobs: Set video timing_adjust to obs video time
    
    When an async video frame comes in and it sets the timing_adjust value
    (used to sync audio to video based upon their timestamps), it would use
    os_gettime_ns as a base.  Instead, it should use OBS' current video
    frame time so that the audio and video playback is as accurate as
    possible relative to the actual exact timestamp of the video frame.
    (Results are almost insignificant, but it's nice to be as precise as
    possible)

    During packet interleaving (for outputs), ensure that if two packets
    coincide with the same timestamp, that the video packet always comes
    first instead of the audio packet.
    
    This fix is required to make FLV demux properly with certain demuxers;
    some FLV demuxers expect the video packet before the audio packet when
    two packets coincide with the same timestamps.

    libobs: Fix starting video packet offset in outputs
    
    (This commit also modifies the obs-outputs module)
    
    The first video packet video offset (the value used to set the starting
    point of video data) would be set to the DTS value of the first video
    packet.  However, when b-frames are used, the first DTS value will be
    negative.  This was originally done because FLV muxing requires that the
    first packet's DTS start from 0.  Unfortunately, this would also
    effectively cause the first packet's PTS/DTS value to be shifted forward
    by the negative amount, which would cause video sync to be off by a
    video frame or two.
    
    This fixes it to start at the PTS value instead and preserve any
    negative offsets.  Additionally, the FLV muxing code has been fixed to
    ensure that it adjusts the starting video DTS to 0, and now correctly
    adjusts the first audio packet's timestamp according to that DTS as well
    (which it didn't do before).

    linux-alsa: Display the "Custom" entry once only
    
    The "Custom" device entry was added inside the loop that runs for each
    device; this causes "Custom" to be added once for each device detected,
    or not at all if no device was detected. Moving this outside the loop
    (as would appear to have been the original intent, judging by the
    indentation) fixes this by adding the entry only after all devices have
    been processed.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix potential seek issues with media source
    
    (This commit also modifies deps/media-playback)
    
    Before, the media-playback library would detect whether something was
    seekable by checking the filename for "://", which is unideal because
    there are other cases where targets may not be seekable.  So instead, an
    explicit "seekable" property (off by default) is now in place in the
    media source when not in "local file" mode.  Seeking will only be
    enabled if local file mode is on, or if "seekable" is explicitly checked
    by the user.

    UI: Lock graphics context when adding new sources
    
    Prevents a potential cross-lock deadlock.  The UI thread would lock the
    scene's mutex in obs_scene_atomic_update, then the item would lock the
    graphics context to create a texture.  Meanwhile in the video thread, it
    could lock the graphics context in the render loop, then lock the
    scene's mutex when rendering.  When doing anything graphics-related, the
    graphics context is always supposed to be locked before the scene's
    mutex is supposed to be locked (it's designed that way), and the
    obs_scene_atomic_update would just bypass that.

    obs-outputs: Improve new netcode if encoder reports 0 bitrate
    
    Some encoders such as the AMD AMF encoder don't set their bitrate
    property, so it gets returned as 0. This causes the new network code to
    allocate a tiny buffer, resulting in output starvation and throttling
    to the point of uselessness if low latency mode is also enabled.

    UI/updater: Improved handling of failure conditions
    
    Currently if a file is partially written to (eg, the file is opened for
    writing but the write fails), the updater won't correctly roll back to the
    previous version, leaving the OBS install in an inconsistent state.
    
    We now track failed installs or hash failures on patched files with a new
    STATE_INSTALL_FAILED state and properly roll back on errors.

    When updating large files such as libcef, the patching process can take a

    frozen. Now it shows the process of the install / patching process.

    obs-x264: Remove VFR mode as an advanced option
    
    VFR encoding mode was originally added experimentally, but in truth,
    it's nothing but a detriment because it can cause wild bitrate
    fluctuations.  It's still a constant framerate even when VFR mode is on
    anyway.

    enc-amf: Update to 2.2.1
    
    With the newly released Driver 17.7.2, AMD fixed many reported issues and added some much wanted features:
    
    - Pre-Pass and VBAQ are finally working,
    - H265/HEVC content can distinguish between IDR- and I- Frames
    - and also supports Color Range and Color Space now,
    - and the 32-bit only text log crash was fixed.
    
    And now it's time for the plugin to also be updated! This release primarily aims at adding support for AMF 1.4.4 and improving support for older drivers, with some of the recently discovered bugs and crashes fixed.
    
    Hotfix 1: Fixed VBAQ and Pre-Pass being used with Constant QP, causing significant corruption issues and changed some default values for H265.
    
    ## Changelog
    ### 2.2.1
    * Fixed a frame corruption bug with Constant QP caused by toggling VBAQ and Pre-Pass after it had already been applied.
    * Changed the default value of 'Enforce HRD' to 'Enabled' for H265/HEVC encoding.
    * Changed the default value of 'Deblocking Filter' to 'Disabled' for H265/HEVC encoding to fix corruption in strict decoders. (Premiere Pro, After Effects, Vegas, VLC (Software))
    
    ### 2.2.0
    * Added support for AMF 1.4.4 and improved support for older drivers like 16.11.5 and 16.12.1.
    * Fixed a memory corruption crash due to misuse of managed DirectX 11 objects.
    * Fixed a frame corruption bug caused by applying 'VBAQ' and 'Pre-Pass' when using 'Constant QP' Rate Control Method.
    * Fixed a string comparison bug causing Simple Output Mode to always use the Profile 'Constrained Baseline'
    * Fixed a crash when enabling 'Debug' on 32-bit OBS caused by different type sizes.
    * Fixed a crash with H265/HEVC caused by use of the undocumented Intra-Refresh properties.
    * Changed the default value for 'Profile' to 'High'.
    * Changed the default value for 'VBAQ' to 'Disabled' for improved performance.
    * Changed the default value for 'Queue Size' to 8 for improved stability in spontaneous load situations.
    * Changed the log crash work around to only apply to older AMF versions than 1.4.4.
    * Removed unnecessary configuration changes.
    * Removed unsupported Pre-Pass options 'Half Size' and 'Quarter Size'.

    This commit fixes two regressions introduced by the modular UI (commit
    25bb8a444fb3a7ca6c19a429f2d89e83a6ddb823):
    
     - the Delete key no longer works in the scene list

    libobs: Log output frame count instead of encoded count

    This reverts commit 4e3e67bb8cf6cb508b4d30b85451c0c4f20b7539.
    
    The way this is handled will erroneously report 0 frames encoded when
    frames have actually been properly encoded, which is best avoided.
    Additionally, and overflow would be generated for drawn frames where
    none occurred before.  The encoded value should probably not even be
    present in the log for the output due to the way it's handled.

    UI: Fix incorrect properties set for Hardware (AMD)
    
    Due to an oversight in enc-amf with strcmp, the code currently causes
    certain weirdness to appear.  This fixes it so it will use "High"
    Profile instead of attempting to use "Constrained Baseline" and also
    changes it to actually set things up for "Constant Bitrate" instead of
    "Variable Bitrate (Latency Constrained)".  Finally I've added a slight
    change that always makes it set the B-Frame Pattern to 0 in order to
    work better with VCE2.0 and VCE3.0 cards.

    and readable. Any smaller, and things became difficult to see and adjust.
    As a note, this does increase the minum width of the settings window, as
    the previous minimum allowed you to cut off objects and render the window
    too small to be usable.

    libobs: Fix item copying during scene duplication
    
    When item in the old scene had only Scale Filter, texture renderer
    was not created for an item in the new scene. However if the item also
    had Crop set, the texture renderer was created.
    
    Now after copying the data, texture renderer is created for the item in
    the new scene when needed.

    libobs: Ensure scene items don't have pre-multiplied alpha
    
    Scene items would incorrectly have pre-multiplied alpha when they were
    scaled with different scale filtering, when they were cropped, or when
    the item itself was a scene.  This happens because the scene renders the
    items to a texture in those cases, and when they are rendered to a
    texture the blend function would be the default srcalpha/invsrcalpha
    blend function, which would cause alpha to become pre-multiplied in the
    texture's result rather than straight alpha.
    
    This changes the behavior to directly copy the color/alpha to the
    texture using the one/zero blend function instead, which makes the
    resulting texture straight alpha.  (Note that you do not want to turn
    off the blend mode for the same result because certain sources can have
    custom drawing that may rely on blending being available)

    obs-transitions: Add stinger transition
    
    Allows using a video file as a means of transitioning, transitioning two
    targets at a specific time during the video playback.  Audio for target
    A fades out to the transition point, and then audio for target B fades
    in after the transition point.

    libobs: Add ability for transitions to render sources directly
    
    For specific types of transitions (stingers in this case), there is no

    NOTE: This functionality should be considered temporary as a seamless
    means of implementing support for different output types within the same
    service.  Ideally, different services should be used for this
    functionality.

    libobs: Add ability for service to specify its output type
    
    Allows the ability to change the output type in case one service
    requires a different output type.
    
    NOTE: This should be considered a temporarily yet simple solution to a
    specific problem: support for RTMP-like outputs.  This will allows
    seamless integration of supporting different RTMP-like output types
    within the same service.  This should probably be replaced with a more
    ideal solution later, such as implementing a completely different
    service type instead, when time permits.

    libobs/util: Make minor optimization to circlebuf pops
    
    If size is 0 after popping data from the front or back, set the
    start/end points to 0 as well to ensure that any subsequent buffer
    pushes start from the beginning of the buffer rather than the middle of
    the buffer.  Reduces potential unnecessary operations in that case.
    
    Additionally, this fixes a bug with circulebuf_pop_back where if start
    position was 0, and all the data was popped off the buffer (equal to the
    capacity), the end position would be equal to the original size.  As an
    example to replicate the bug, push 5, pop 5, then push 10.  The
    start/end points will be invalid.

    libobs: Fix bug where obs_data default might not be set
    
    If a source is created with settings, default values would not be set on
    data items that already had values set.  The check here was supposed to
    be a not equal rather than an equal because you're not supposed to be
    able to set a default value of one type on an item that already exists
    but is of a different type.
    
    This bug would make it so that if a particular setting was removed,
    there would be no default value to fall back on, and it would always be
    0 or NULL for all values.

    there had been no reason to clear or remove settings on most things.

    libobs-d3d11: Fix potential issue rebuilding shared texture
    
    Sometimes when rebuilding a texture, it often has to fall back and
    create a temporary texture, but it'll fail when trying to create a
    shader resource for it.  The suspicion is because it's due to not having
    the proper shader binding flag when creating that temporary texture, so
    this fixes that possible loophole.

    UI: Initialize Stats window values after OBSInit/reset
    
    When the statistics window starts up for the first time, it reset values
    at that very moment so that stray lagged frames due to OBS' startup
    wouldn't be displayed.  However, that's really a bad place to reset
    those values because the user could want to view the stats window after
    a long stream, and having those values reset when he/she views the
    window for the first time would sort of make the point of viewing your
    stats moot.
    
    Instead, reset the values only when applicable, such as after OBSInit or
    when video is reset.

    I believe the issue with the next to impossible frame count to be an integer underflow, as in order to achieve those you'd have to have recorded for at least 345 days with 144 fps. So this commit fixes them by using a normal integer first and then deciding on the result if it should be used or be replaced with a 0.

    win-capture/graphics-hook: Fix D3D10/D3D11 detection
    
    When hooking DXGI-based graphics programs in the hook, the first hook
    point is IDXGISwapChain::Present.  To be able to initiate a capture, a
    pointer to the device context that created the swap chain is required,
    which can be retrieved via IDXGISwapChain::GetDevice.  Determining
    whether the device context was D3D10 or D3D11 has always been somewhat
    of an issue due to D3D10 and D3D11 being nearly identical, as well as
    their interoperability/interchangeability.  The GetDevice function would
    first be called with the UUID of ID3D10Device, then if that failed,
    the UUID of ID3D11Device.
    
    However, with certain specific D3D11 games, GetDevice would for some
    unknown reason succeed with the UUID of ID3D10Device, which would cause
    capture to fail.  (Conversely, attempting to call GetDevice with the
    UUID of ID3D11Device on a device that's actually ID3D10Device would
    always succeed, so reversing the order of the test was not an option).
    There were originally three known D3D11 games that would erroneously
    succeed when querying a D3D10 device interface:  Call of Duty: Ghosts,
    Just Cause 3, and theHunter: Call of the Wild.  All other known D3D11
    games would work correctly.  Because it was only these three games, a
    hack was originally implemented in the form of an executable exception
    list that would force them to capture D3D11.
    
    Unfortunately, Oculus games are now failing under the same circumstance
    as well, so a simple hack will no longer work.  To fix this, a more
    reliable method of detecting which context it is had to be discovered:
    simply check the feature level using ID3D11Device::GetFeatureLevel.  If
    the feature level is D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0 or D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_1,
    the device is definitely a D3D11 device.  Otherwise, continue the tests
    as they were before.  Successfully tested with many D3D10 games, many
    D3D11 games, and especially those three D3D11 games that previously were
    detected as D3D10 erroneously.

    obs-ffmpeg: Don't preload media frames if set to pause on end
    
    Preloading is designed to overwrite the current internal render texture
    of the source so it'll be ready to play the first frame right when the
    source is first displayed.
    
    However, When the media source is set to pause on the last frame, it
    keeps that current render texture visible, so preloading it with the
    first frame will essentially overwrite the current render, causing it to
    inadvertently show and pause on the first frame rather than the last
    frame.  So instead, just disable preloading when the user has it set to
    pause on the last frame.

    UI: Add new theme, update theme capabilities
    
    I have always felt that the out of the box themes for OBS were quite
    lacking, and have spent a lot of time going through and sorting out the
    difficulties with the current setup. I've added a new themeID parameter to
    several elements that were otherwise impossible to target with QSS in a
    theme. Since Qt has pushed for the use of QML over QSS at this point,
    these should be considered workarounds. Included is the theme I was
    working on that can serve as a base. I'm hoping to encourage others to
    make their own themes, so we can grow the available themes for OBS.
    
    I am happy for any feedback on the theme itself, or other updates that
    can me made to make creating new themes easier overall.

    deps/media-playback: Start decoding regardless of keyframe
    
    Currently, when media-playback is used with a network address, video has
    to wait for the first keyframe before it starts decoding.  This is
    probably not wise because the first packet of video may contain
    additional header information, and because audio is forced to wait and
    buffer while waiting for a keyframe, potentially causing a lot of audio
    to get backed up unnecessarily which could inadvertently cause sync or
    audio playback issues.
    
    So, instead of waiting for a keyframe before decoding starts, decode
    right away, and make it wait for a keyframe before calling the video
    callback instead.

    UI/installer: Specify "source" in plugins section
    
    When using the full installer, there'll be a section where you can
    choose what to install -- one section is a tree view with a "plugins"
    section, and in that section there's "Browser plugin" and "Realsense
    plugin".  Instead of superfluously saying "plugin" for each of those,
    replace with "source" instead -- so browser source and realsense source.
    Also somewhat helps prevent the user from getting confused and thinking
    we're installing a browser or something.

    UI: Fix autoconfig capping bitrate with "custom server"
    
    When custom server is used, it would still use the "common" RTMP service
    to cap its bitrate.  So if Twitch was selected and you changed over to
    custom RTMP server, it would still cap to Twitch's bitrate limits even
    though you're not using Twitch anymore.

    libobs: Fix bug where outputs would not set stopped event
    
    When an output fails to connect and it's already been prematurely
    stopped, the event to mark the output as stopped would not be signaled,
    causing obs_output_destroy to lock up indefinitely while waiting for the
    event to be signaled.

    UI: Unlock mutex before trying to stop output
    
    Prevents the output from hard-locking on itself when the stop call would
    trigger the callback and then try to lock again.  Probably could be
    solved with a recursive mutex, but at that point it's not really
    necessary.

    libobs: Always call stop callback
    
    Rather than have the back-end try to determine whether the output can or
    cannot stop, allow the stop callback to continue in the plugin either
    way and let the plugin itself make that determination.
    
    This fixes a bug where the back-end wouldn't have data active while
    connecting, therefore the stop callback wouldn't be called, and once
    connected it wouldn't know that it was supposed to stop.  In other words
    trying to call obs_output_stop on an output that was in a state of
    connecting would do nothing and the output would never stop.

    crash because this wasn't being taken in to account, and it would
    traverse in to invalid memory.

    libobs-d3d11: Only load vertex buffer before drawing
    
    Fixes a bug where loading vertex shaders could cause error messages
    about mismatching vertex buffer data to appear because the vertex shader
    would try to reload the previously used vertex buffer.

    UI: Fix creation of log files with non-english paths
    
    This commit fixes creating log files in windows with Unicode profile
    names.
    
    I encountered this bug when running obs-studio 18.0.2 in Windows 8.1 x64
    with my user profile path containing Unicode characters.
    
    Steps to reproduce:
    
    1) Create a windows user with a Unicode name: "пользователь"
    2) Run OBS Studio, go to Help -> Log Files -> View current log (Nothing
    happens)
    
    The expected result is opening current log file.
    
    Closes jp9000/obs-studio#916

    UI: Prevent user from starting ouputs while in settings
    
    There's a loophole that would allow users to activate an output while in
    the settings window via hotkeys -- this prevents that from being able to
    happen.  Note that users can still shut down outputs, but they can no
    longer start them up while in the settings window.

    Instead, if an output is currently active, do not reset video.

    Uses a named mutex to detect if multiple instances of the program are
    open, and if so warns the user.  When running in portable mode, uses a
    separate unique mutex name mapped to the user's config directory to
    ensure that no two portable builds use the same config directory.  This
    way, portable builds do not conflict with normal builds or other
    separate portable builds.

    libobs: Don't use source flags for async buffering
    
    (This commit also modifies the decklink, linux-v4l2, mac-avcapture,
    obs-ffmpeg, and win-dshow modules)
    
    Originally, async buffering for sources was supposed to be a
    user-controllable flag.  However, that turned out to be less than ideal
    because sources (such as the win-dshow plugin) were programmed with
    automatic control over their buffering (such as automatically detecting
    USB 2.0 capture devices and then enabling in those cases).
    
    The fact that it was a flag caused a design flaw to where buffering
    values would be overwritten when a source is loaded from save data.
    
    Because of that, this flag is being deprecated and replaced with a
    specific function to enable unbuffered mode instead.

    Would cause other flags to stop saving.  Buffering needs to be split off
    from the source flags.

    UI: Add auto-configuration wizard
    
    The auto-configuration wizard is designed to allow first-time or
    novice/uneducated users or to set up video and encoding settings in a
    very quick and easy way.  It'll automatically perform a bandwidth test,
    and/or test the user's video settings to determine the most ideal
    settings for streaming and recording (assuming a 1-pc setup).

    UI: Add 1920x1080/1280x720 to the settings base res list
    
    Adds 1920x1080 and 1280x720 to the drop-down list of "default"
    base/canvas resolutions rather than just the user's monitor resolutions,
    in case the user wants to set the canvas to 1920x1080 or 1280x720
    without having to manually type it in.  Added as a minor convenience.

Date:   Fri Apr 28 18:02:03 2017 -0700

    UI: Limit default canvas res to 1920x1080 or below
    
    The reasoning behind this is because having a very large canvas size can
    negatively affect the user experience -- most sources end up seeming
    smaller than they need to be to users, resulting in the user needing to
    size up the sources, or in the case of webcams it makes the user try to
    use much larger webcam resolutions than they should reasonably need to
    do, resulting in higher unintentional resource usage.  The program will
    additionally require more fillrate to render and downscale things as
    well.
    
    This applies only to the default starting base/canvas resolution for new
    users only.
    
    Additionally, users that ran the program pre-19 will be unaffected by
    this change, as it will detect that and set the old defaults to prevent
    an unexpected change in resolution for those users.

    UI: Don't subject base/output resolutions defaults
    
    If defaults change for the base or output resolutions, it could
    unintentionally affect users who are using defaults by chance and have
    never changed those values.
    
    Instead, save those values are soon as defaults are set if the users
    haven't already set them.

    obs-outputs: Fix frame dropping when using ultrafast
    
    x264 on ultrafast won't drop any b-frames, so it might buffer packets a
    bit too much in that case.
    
    The frame drop duration calculation now searches for the first valid
    video frame within the packets buffer.  Additionally, it no longer
    prevents frame dropping for a specific time after dropping frames,
    because the first case eliminates the need for that.

    libobs: Fix tex.Load lookup (needs int3, not int2)
    
    libobs' shader language is basically HLSL, and tex.Load uses an int3 for
    2D textures, with texture mipmap index for the last component.  This bug
    bypassed testing because the front-end automatically switches to OpenGL
    if D3D11 initialization fails, and when converted to GLSL, works fine
    because texelFetch only requires two components.  This also means
    there's a bug in GLSL shader conversion code, because it's essentially
    ignoring the third component when it shouldn't be.

    should always be available, so this should clear up that last remaining

    frontend-plugins: Abstract captions
    
    Currently the captioning code is a bit intertwined with the UI, and the
    captioning is hard-coded towards microsoft speech API.
    
    This patch abstracts captions to allow other APIs to be implemented
    later.

    Changing the name of certain captions source files so it specifies which

    "Text (GDI+)" as the source name in that case)

    executable.
    
    Additionally changes the text associated with these selections to

    UI: Ctrl+E to Edit Transform
    
    Added a shortcut to "Edit Transform", with Ctrl+E (lines 1191-1193).
    Editing was very easy in OBS Classic, and I could not find the option
    for stretching a source to bounds in OBS Studio, so the "Edit Transform"
    dialogue should be more user-facing. Giving it a keyboard shortcut
    denotes that it is important enough to have a shortcut, as opposed
    to the myriad options with no shortcut

    UI: Hide OpenGL and D3D adapter on Windows
    
    OpenGL on Windows is rather unstable and can result in graphical
    corruption or the complete inability to start OBS since some GPUs do not
    support the minimum requirements after switching to OpenGL. The UI option
    is now hidden unless --allow-opengl is passed on the command line.
    
    The D3D adapter is currently unused and we often find users are concerned
    when their GPU does not appear in the list.

    obs-ffmpeg/nvenc: Remove "default" preset
    
    The "default" preset is not an actual default, but something Nvidia
    decided to just call that way.  It yields the worst quality per bitrate
    out of all the presets, for no actual benefits.  The actual FFmpeg
    default is the hq one, which yields the best quality, especially when
    twopass mode is enabled.
    
    I can't think of a way to keep the "default" preset in a non-confusing
    way, and as it gives no known benefits, might as well just remove it
    entirely.
    
    (Jim edit: Also made it so that if the settings have it set to
    "default", it automatically treats it as "hq")

    image-source: Move file modification check before animation processing
    
    The code to process GIF animations contains a return statement that
    skiped the file modification check, if the source is not in an active
    scene. Like that images in the preview scene of studio mode would never
    update, when they get modified on disk.
    
    Also reloading the image, if an animation file has been modified before
    processing the old animation that will be replaced later anyway, seems
    like a better way to do it.

    win-dshow: Actually fix LGP issue
    
    The LGP issue is caused by the device drivers returning two or more
    packets in a single segment of audio data.  This fixes it by detecting
    that and decoding subsequent packets.
    
    When the FFmpeg audio decoder returns, it returns how many bytes of data
    was decoded.  To have it decode multiple packets in a single segment,
    just subtract the return value from the expected size, and if that size
    is still larger than zero, then there are more packets in the segment to
    decode.  Otherwise, stop.

    UI: Don't exit on unknown command line arguments
    
    OBS Browser Source uses command line arguments for flags. Exiting on
    command line arguments that are unknown to OBS prevent's that
    functionality from working.

    UI: Update Simple Mode AMD Presets
    
    Due to the default value assigned to AMF.H264.VBVBuffer.Strictness and AMF.H264.Version, the config upgrade code ran every time someone tried to use simple mode. That caused the AMF.H264.VBVBuffer.Strictness value to always be stuck at 100, which is wrong for streaming and recording.

    UI: If scene/source names exist, start from 2
    
    Currently if you have a scene, "Scene" for example, and you create a new
    scene, the dialog will pop up with a default name, but it'll start with
    "Scene 1" instead of "Scene 2".  Same thing occurs with sources.  This
    fixes that to start from 2 instead.

    In some cases the result of the compatability check is wrong.
    For example the format "mpegts" only shows "mpeg2video" as an

    ffmpeg's muxer for that container and are used within that container
    in some applications.

    UI: Add support for other codecs
    
    This changes the logic to show all encoders in the Recording tab but
    only show selected supported codecs in the Streaming tab (at least with
    Advanced Output Mode).  The only (to my knowledge) streaming format that
    supports other formats than H264 is WebRTC, which in theory should
    support H264, VP8, VP9 and HEVC.  However I don't know about any ingest
    server that works well with it yet.

    obs-transitions: Convert premultiplied alpha to straight
    
    In transitions, because the 'to' and 'from' are always rendered to
    textures, the end result will always have premultiplied alpha.  This
    would cause alpha to have blackish edges during transition, and cause
    semi-transparent images to appear darker than they were supposed to.
    
    To replicate, simply set the transparency of a source to 50%, then
    transition between that scene and another scene.  The source will appear
    to "pop" in and out unnaturally due to the premultiplied alpha effect of
    the render targets.
    
    To fix this, the solution is to simply convert premultiplied alpha to
    straight alpha in the transition pixel shaders.

    than necessary to output audio data.  When that happens, it causes audio
    monitoring to get backed up and get unnecessarily delayed, as well as
    cause general audio buffering in libobs to increase unnecessarily.
    
    A simple fix both in terms of preventing that stall and improving UI
    performance is to not call invokeMethod to update the widget each time,
    and then instead have those widgets update themselves via a timer at a
    specific interval.

    win-wasapi: Mark audio outputs as unmonitorable
    
    (Note: This commit also modifies mac-capture and linux-pulseaudio)
    
    This prevents outputs from being monitored, preventing a potential
    feedback loop.

    libobs: Implement audio monitoring
    
    Adds functions to turn on audio monitoring to allow the user to hear
    playback of an audio source over the user's speaker.  It can be set to
    turn off monitoring and only output to stream, or it can be set to
    output only to monitoring, or it can be set to both.
    
    On windows, audio monitoring uses WASAPI.  Windows also is capable of
    syncing the audio to the video according to when the video frame itself
    was played.
    
    On mac, it uses AudioQueue.
    
    On linux, it's not currently implemented and won't do anything (to be
    implemented).

    libobs: Add optional ultrawide -> wide scaling techniques
    
    This algorithm reduces scaling distortion on the center of the image
    when scaling from ultrawide to wide.
    
    (Jim: edited effect files to prevent an impact in performance for
    standard scaling.  Now effectively generates an extra pixel shader, and
    the extra code is only applied to the DrawUndistort technique, while the
    original Draw technique is unaffected due to the compiler automatically
    removing unused code branches via the hard-coded boolean value)

    obs-x264: Allow opencl through much longer alias
    
    Due to the fact that people follow terrible guides that ignorantly
    recommend opencl, the "opencl" custom x264 option was blocked.  However,
    because some people still apparently want to use it, it's being renamed
    to "opencl_is_experimental_and_potentially_unstable" so that anyone who
    uses this option realizes that they should probably think twice about
    using the option rather than just follow some terrible guide that tells
    them to use it.

    win-capture: Don't use FindWindow for game capture keepalive
    
    Using and creating a window can use issues in game capture if multiple
    game captures are active, so revert back to using a mutex, and just
    ignore the keepalive check failure if injected inside a UWP program
    (only check to see if GetLastError reports that it's not found -- if it
    returns access denied or any other error, assume it's in a UWP program,
    and ignore the keepalive check).

    FFmpeg by default decodes VP8/VP9 via its internal encoders, however
    those internal encoders do not support alpha.  Encoded alpha is stored
    via meta/side data in the container, so the only way to decode it
    properly is via forcing FFmpeg to use libvpx for decoding.

    libobs: Fix caption encoder packet reallocation
    
    Captions do something unusual with encoder packets: they reallocate them
    due to appending extra h.264 data.  Due to the way allocations are
    handled with core encoder packets (they now store a reference in their
    data), instead of modifying the encoder data directly, create a new
    encoder packet instead and release the old packet.

    frontend-tools: Detach caption thread if critical failure
    
    Prevents the thread from being considered "active" if a critical failure
    occur, so calling the stop function won't be necessary.

    frontend-tools: Add caption generation tool (windows)
    
    Allows generating captions via the windows speech recognition API
    (SAPI).
    
    This is currently marked as experimental due to speech recognition
    technology still being less than ideal.  Speech recognition technology
    in general is probably never going to be anywhere near perfect.
    Microsoft's speech recognition in particular requires a bit of training
    via the windows speech recognition tool to ensure it can dictate better.
    Clear speech with a good mic is recognized fairly well, but casual
    speech and/or speaking with a poor microphone will have some significant
    issues.  Captions can often be way off when speaking casually rather
    than with clear diction.

    obs-qsv11: Use d3d9 allocator on Win7
    
    Use a d3d9 device and allocator to encode in QSV.
    
    This fixes a random crash that could only happen on Windows 7. The QSV
    Deviced returned a DEVICE_FAILURE after a random amount of time with the
    old method.
    
    This fix is totally based on Shinck's QSVHelper.exe patch for OBS
    Classic (see
    https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/0-633b-qsvhelper-exe-was-killed-encode-failed.19230/page-3#post-161984
    for more information)
    
    This is more like a proof of concept, but that fix is currently stable
    and tested more than 50 hours, with a single session of +14 hours.
    
    That commit doesn't respect all OBS Guidelines. It is currently
    recommended to wait for a more "cleaner" implementation.

    libobs: Process all scene audio actions if no audio playing
    
    When there are audio sources in a scene and they've all stopped playing
    their audio (audio is pending), all scene item audio actions (volume
    changes, toggling visibility) will perpetually buffer and no longer be
    processed until audio plays again.
    
    So instead of that, if all audio sources have stopped playing in the
    scene, just process all pending scene item audio actions immediately to
    prevent them from never being processed while waiting for a scene item
    to start playing audio.

    libobs: Fix possible reverse order mutex hard lock
    
    For displays, instead of using the draw_callbacks_mutex and risk a
    reverse mutual lock scenario, use a separate mutex to lock display size
    data.
    
    This bug was exposed when trying to reorder filters in the UI module.
    The UI thread would try to reorder the filters, locking the filter mutex
    of the source, and then the reorder would signal the UI to resize the
    display, so the display would lock its draw_callbacks_mutex.  Then, in
    the graphics thread, it would lock the display's draw_callbacks_mutex,
    try to draw the source, and then the source would try to lock that same
    filter mutex.
    
    A mutex trace:
    UI thread -> lock source filter mutex -> waiting on display mutex

    UI: Fix property name bug in frontend API
    
    This commit fixes a bug that would cause the frontend API function
    obs_frontend_set_current_scene_collection to never be successful.  Due
    to the bug, the following null pointer check would always fail, so the
    action would never be triggered.
    
    Modification by Jim: Instead of fixing the typo that caused this to
    occur, make it so both scene collection menus and profile menus both use
    "file_name" consistently.
    
    Closes jp9000/obs-studio#712

    win-capture: Do not fall back to other windows for UWP windows
    
    If capturing a UWP window, do not fall back to matching windows with the
    same window class if the exact window is not found, as this will get any
    other UWP window on the system (due to the fact that they all have the
    same window class name).

    win-capture: Create all named objects within hook
    
    All named objects (including file mapped shared memory) need to be
    created within the hook itself due to the fact that UWP programs cannot
    access named objects outside of the UWP process.
    
    Because shared memory needs to be created within the hook, the capture
    loop cannot start until the shared memory has been filled with valid
    data.  Creating an additional "initialize" event fixes this issue.
    
    Additionally, changed the way that named kernel objects are
    opened/created.  Before, there were functions that would first try to
    open named objects and then implicitly create them if opening failed
    (assuming that if the hook didn't create it first, game capture would),
    now it's been changed so that you can only either explicitly open or
    create.

    win-capture: Use window for keepalive check
    
    To check to make sure game capture is still active in the capture
    program, it currently uses a named event, and then it checks to see if
    that named event exists.  However with UWP programs, you can't open a
    named event outside of the UWP process.  FindWindow on the other hand
    does work, so instead of checking to see if a named kernel object
    exists, create a window and check to see if that window exists.

    win-capture: Fix getting proper UWP window handles
    
    The "main" windows detected for UWP programs are basically to help
    sandbox the programs -- they run in the ApplicationFrameHost process and
    help reduce the possibility of other programs trying to access the
    actual process window, which is a child window.
    
    To bypass this, go through the list of child windows for the
    ApplicationFrameHost window, and then find the one that's attached to
    a different process; that different process will always be the target,
    and will allows us to open the actual process of the UWP program.

    libobs: Fix bug where outputs cannot initialize hotkeys
    
    When an output's context data is being created, it cannot register any
    hotkeys because the output has not initialized its reference counting
    capability.  This is due to the fact that when a hotkey is registered,
    it creates a weak reference to the source/output/service/encoder.
    
    The solution to this is to make sure the output's reference counter data
    is created before calling the create callback.

    This reverts commit 0edaebe192839083528c856bd0d9e1bcab7a8006.
    
    The commit was actually less optimal than it was before.  Shaders are
    always fully unfolded and both sides of a branch are always executed.
    Despite that fact, the "avoid branching" commit actually *added* two
    extra unnecessary instructions with the same number of actual sample
    instructions, making it arguably less optimal than before.
    
    This was tested via the D3DDissamble function.

    libobs-opengl: Add xcb message poll to empty out the queue
    
    The xcb message queue is not currently emptied.  If errors are generated
    by any void requests the message queue will simply fill up and messages
    will never be deleted.
    
    Due to a (currently unknown) other problem this happens for me, and
    results in OBS using up all memory with a queue that will never be
    emptied.
    
    Here we add a poll loop that will empty the xcb message queue and
    discard the messages.  While this means that errors are still not
    handled, OBS wont end up crashing either.

    obs-qsv11: Manually mark priority bits for QSV frames
    
    QSV frame priority bits are not being marked correctly; their priorities
    are always marked either low or disposable, whereas I-frames should be
    marked as highest (3), P-frames should be marked as high (2), and other
    frames should be marked as either low or disposable.  This helps ensure
    that the correct frames are dropped when frames need to be dropped.

    There are two variables used for 'priority', the general marked frame
    priority, and the drop priority.  They can sometimes be different
    because some encoders don't always use the correct frame priority.

    UI: Fix scrolling while preview is locked
    
    As reboot pointed out, it's assumed that the intention of a locked
    preview is to prevent editing the scene. Because scrolling the preview
    does not have any interaction with the scene and its sources, you should
    be able to still scroll around and look at different parts of your
    preview while the preview is locked.
    
    There is also a bugfix included: previously, if you were to
    right click while space bar was held down, you would be stuck in
    scroll mode until spacebar is pressed/released again. This gets around
    it by forcing scroll mode to end when a right click is issued on the
    preview.

    libobs: Ensure async source sizes are always reset
    
    If an async source is cropped on one side, then when the program is
    restarted and the source is loaded from file, the async source will
    start out with a width/height of zero.  This will cause the async source
    to not be drawn if cropping or scale filtering is added to the scene
    item, because it has to be rendered to a texture first.  However, the
    source cannot reset its size until it's drawn, so it leaves it in
    perpetual state of having a 0x0 size.
    
    This fixes that problem by ensuring that the async source size is always
    reset even when not being rendered.

    UI: Add preview scaling options
    
    Adds preview scaling to the right-click context menu for the preview
    pane.  This allows the ability to, for example, zoom the preview and
    edit the preview 1:1 (canvas/base resolution).  This was a missing
    parity feature.  Additionally, also allows scaling to the
    "output/scaled" resolution the program is set to.
    
    When the preview is in scale mode and is the focused widget, you can
    hold space and drag with left click to change the zoomed position.

    win-capture: Cache cursor textures to prevent reallocation
    
    Whenever a cursor is captured and the cursor icon changes, it creates a
    new texture.  This isn't particularly optimal, so instead just store a
    cache of cursor textures (based on size), and make the textures dynamic.
    Doing this will prevent unnecessary texture reallocation.

    libobs-d3d11: Rebuild device and assets if device removed/reset
    
    Due to an NVIDIA driver bug with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update,
    there are an increasingly large number of reports of "Device Removed"
    errors and TDRs.  When this happens, OBS stops outputting all data
    because all graphics functions are failing, and it appears to just
    "freeze up" for users.
    
    To temporarily alleviate this issue while waiting for it to be fixed,
    the D3D subsystem can be rebuilt when that happens, all assets can be
    reloaded to ensure that it can continue functioning (with a minor hiccup
    in playback).
    
    To allow rebuilding the entire D3D subsystem, all objects that contain
    D3D references must be part of a linked list (with a few exceptions) so
    we can quickly traverse them all whenever needed, and all data for those
    resources (static resources primarily, such as shaders, textures, index
    buffers, vertex buffers) must be stored in RAM so they can be recreated
    whenever needed.
    
    Then if D3D reports a "device removed" or "device reset" error, all D3D
    references must first be fully released with no stray references; the
    linked list must be fully traversed until all references are released.
    Then, the linked list must once again be traversed again, and all those
    D3D objects must be recreated with the same data and descriptors (which
    are now saved in each object).  Finally, all states need to be reset.
    
    After that's complete, the device is able to continue functioning almost
    as it was before, although the output to recording/stream may get a few
    green frames due to texture data being reset.
    
    This will temporarily alleviate the "Device Removed" issue while waiting
    for a fix from NVIDIA.

    frontend-tools: Fix crash when adding invalid regex
    
    When adding a new regex rule to the Automatic Scene Switcher, OBS would
    crash if the regex was invalid. This was because the regex was added to
    the Regex object without a test or try-catch. This commit fixes that
    behavior, and adds a warning message when attempting to add an invalid
    regex.

    librtmp: Remove reconnect on close behavior
    
    For some reason librtmp treats a close message as a request to reconnect.
    It does this syncronously, and uses the same event processing so that
    another close request will continue the cycle until the stack is exhausted
    and the application crashes.

    rtmp-services: Remove Twitch H264 profile requirement
    
    Twitch no longer recommend Main profile on their "Broadcast requirements"
    page. The number of devices that can't decode High profile is very small
    and limited to old, legacy devices such as the 1st generation iPad (six
    years old). Additionally, these devices have limited resolution / FPS
    support, so streams are often encoded at levels beyond what they could
    decode even disregarding the H264 profile requirement. It's not worth
    degrading the quality of streams for modern devices just to support these
    legacy decoders. Twitch still provides low-complexity transcodes for
    devices which cannot handle Source quality streams.

    When a pulseaudio source is created from existing settings and the
    device is not found, then the private data will return NULL, making it
    impossible to change the source to use a different device.  NULL should
    never be returned when possible, otherwise settings cannot be changed

    image-source: Reload file when timestamp has changed
    
    This commit fixes the issue outlined in the following thread:
    https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/50045/
    
    When the image source file was replaced by an outside process, it would
    only reload when the file's new timestamp was newer than the file's
    previous timestamp.  This fixes that behavior.  Now an image source
    will reload any time the file's new timestamp is different than its
    previous timestamp.

    UI: Add ability to forcibly stop streams/recordings
    
    If the user hits the "stop stream" button it'll transition in to
    "stopping stream..." and will continue to output until the stream
    reaches the timing in which "stop" was pressed.
    
    However, if there is significant congestion, stopping the stream can
    take far longer than the user may like.  So there needs to be an option
    to forcibly stop the stream in that case; pushing the "stop" button a
    second time should allow the user to tell the stream/recording to stop
    right away instead of waiting for the precise stop timing.

    libobs: Allow forced stop even when already stopping
    
    Allow outputs to force a stop even when already in the process of
    stopping.  If for example a stream is heavily congested and taking a
    very long time to stop, this allows frontends to give the users the
    option to forcibly stop the stream to make it stop as quickly as
    possible.

    UI: Change certain scene functions to slot functions
    
    This allows using the functions via Qt message queue.  The reason for
    this is so a frontend API can queue these functions to call safely from
    another thread.

    obs-outputs: Allow p-frames to be dropped
    
    Previously, for an unknown reason p-frames were marked as highest
    priority along with i-frames (keyframes), which means they could not be
    dropped.  This would cause a problem where if for whatever reason
    there's too much congestion, data would continually buffer.  This fixes
    the issue by dropping p-frames at a separate (higher) threshold than
    b-frames.

    libobs: Do not set p-frames to highest priority
    
    P-frames were initially set as highest priority to prevent them from
    being dropped (not sure what the rationale was behind this), but this
    caused a problem where if there's too much congestion for whatever
    reason data will continue to stay buffered, so to prevent this p-frames
    should be droppable.

    obs-outputs: Improve frame drop testing
    
    Measures packet data rate and sleeps to prevent data from going above
    the set data rate.  Uncomment the TEST_FRAMEDROPS macro, then set
    DROPTEST_MAX_KBPS to the desired kb/s (for example 3000 for 3000
    kilobits per second), and then it will limit the data rate to that
    specified amount, forcing the thread to sleep to ensure it can only
    output the desired data rate.

    Annoyingly this means that the hotkey will still be shown to the user,
    possibly confusing the user as to whether they can use it, but for the
    time being it's better than having their hotkey configuration removed
    each time they change the mode.

    UI: Don't log initialization profiling redundantly
    
    This data isn't typically extremely important to have logged on startup,
    and it's already included as part of shutdown.  There may be scenarios
    where a program crashes and that information would be lost due to the
    fact that the shutdown logging never occurs, but that information is
    unlikely to be useful in that scenario.

    libobs: Reduce unnecessary logging (info -> debug)
    
    (Note: This commit also modifies coreaudio-encoder, win-capture, and
    win-mf modules)
    
    This reduces logging to the user's log file.  Most of the things
    specified are not useful for examining log files, and make reading log
    files more painful.
    
    The things that are useful to log should be up to the front-end to
    implement.  The core and core plugins should have minimal mandatory
    logging.

    win-capture: Add game capture hotkey support
    
    Changed the first property of game capture to be a "mode" list (with
    "any fullscreen window", "specific window", and "hotkey").
    
    When hotkey mode is set, it'll add a hotkey pair to hotkey settings to
    activate/deactivate game capture.  When the hotkey to activate is
    pressed, it'll treat the current foreground window as the target window
    similar to "selected window" mode; it'll keep trying to capture the same
    window even if the window or its application closes/reopens, and will
    continue to do so until deactivated via the deactivate hotkey, or until
    a new window is set via the activate hotkey.

    obs-filters: Handle timestamp jumps for noise sup. filter
    
    When buffering audio data, we don't want to buffer audio data that may
    be old.  If the audio timing jumps significant and old audio data is
    buffered, clear that old data.

Author: jp9000 <obs.jim@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jul 26 04:12:55 2016 -0700

    obs-filters: Buffer noise suppression audio data
    
    The noise suppression filter mistakenly operated on the assumption that
    input audio data would always be in 10ms segments, and would crash if
    audio data was larger than that size.
    
    Because speexdsp operates on fixed audio frame sizes only, we must
    buffer audio data to fit that frame processing size.  This creates a
    troublesome situation where you must buffer around that specified frame
    size.
    
    The new steps for processing are:
    1. Push audio data to input circular buffer.
    2. Push number of audio frames and timestamp for that audio packet to an
       'info' circular buffer.
    3. Check size of input circular buffer, and while it's equal to or above
       the speexdsp frame size (10ms for minimum latency), pop from the
       input buffer to a temporary buffer (10ms frames) and process it, then
       push that temporary buffer to the output circular buffer.
    4. Peek at the front of the 'info' circular buffer.
    5. If the output circular buffer frame size is equal or larger than next
       expected number of frames, pop both the info and output buffer, and
       return the audio data with the expected audio frames/timestamp.

    libVLC doesn't seem to provide full speaker configuration info, so when

    This change makes it so that libVLC does the downmixing to stereo rather
    than libobs, just due to that lack of speaker configuration info.

    obs-filters: Fix scroll filter sampler state
    
    When the crop filter was changed to a crop/pad filter, the sampler state
    was changed to use a transparent border for the U/V addressing mode.
    However, what was not realized at the time was that the scroll filter
    also shared the crop effect file, and the scroll filter depended on the
    old sampler state (wrap u/v).
    
    This fixes the issue by simply setting a u/v wrap sampler state in the
    scroll filter.

    UI: Make third-party plugins use program data dirs
    
    Makes it so third-party plugins are stored in system-local specific data
    directories (except on linux, which will still use user-local data
    directories for the time being)

    UI: Allow directories in file formatting settings
    
    When configuring file formatting settings in advanced, allow the ability
    to specify formatted directories.
    
    For example, "%CCYY-%MM/%DD %hh-%mm-%ss"
    
    would make the year and month a subdirectory, then the
    day/hour/minute/seconds as the file name.  January 21st 2121 at 4pm
    would end up being:
    
    "21 04-00-00.mp4" in the subdirectory "2121-01".

    UI: Fix window start pos when not inside a monitor
    
    Commit 8932bd39 attempted to fix the starting position when the program
    started up inside of a monitor that no longer exists, but it was
    incorrectly assumed that it would cause the program to automatically
    center its position.  Instead it set its position to {0,0}, which is a
    really awkward position.
    
    This fixes that commit and ensures the window starts up centered to the
    primary display when its saved starting position is invalid.

    The active_refs and show_refs variable would only increment/decrement

    case of scenes within scenes, sub-sources of scenes within scenes would
    end up having the wrong ref values.

    UI: Show "stopping" text on buttons when waiting for stop
    
    The new cutoff timing fix means that streaming/recording has to remain
    active for bit until the stream/recording has reached the expecting stop
    timestamp.  This means that the buttons would continue to say "Stop
    streaming/recording" while waiting for the output to stop itself at the
    appropriate timing.
    
    So instead of letting it do that and confusing the user, the buttons
    will now say "stopping" when the button is pressed to indicate to the
    user that the stream/recording is in the process of stopping.

    obs_output_info::void (*stop)(void *data);
    
    To:
    obs_output_info::void (*stop)(void *data, uint64_t ts);
    
    This fixes the long-time design flaw where obs_output_stop and the
    output 'stop' callback would just shut down the output without
    considering the timing of when obs_output_stop was used, discarding any
    possible buffering and causing the output to get cut off at an
    unexpected timing.
    
    The 'stop' callback of obs_output_info now takes a timestamp with the
    expectation that the output will use that timestamp to stop output data
    in accordance to that timing.  obs_output_stop now records the timestamp
    at the time that the function is called and calls the 'stop' callback
    with that timestamp.  If needed, obs_output_force_stop will still stop
    the output immediately without buffering.

    vlc-video: Add VLC video source
    
    Adds the ability to add video playlists via libvlc instead of via the
    media source.  This is mostly just being added as a secondary option to
    the media source to reduce maintenance costs and save time.  Currently
    libff cannot pause/unpause/seek, and isn't programmed to handle
    playlists yet.
    
    If VLC is installed on the computer (with the same architecture) it will
    allow video playback via libVLC.  In the future, users should be able to
    optionally download VLC libraries via the installer as well if they
    don't want to necessarily install VLC to get the plugin working.
    
    This plugin performs runtime linking instead of compile-time linking;
    compiling VLC is not required, only its headers are required.  To
    compile, clone the VLC repository and set the VLCPath cmake variable to
    point to the VLC repository directory.

    linux-capture: Fix window capture crashes
    
    The xcomposite window capture crashes were due to a few factors:
    -------------------------------
    1.) The source's X error handler was possibly being overwritten by
    another part of the program despite us locking the display, presumably
    something in Qt which isn't locking the display when pushing/popping its
    own error handler (though this is not yet certain).  The source's calls
    to X functions happen in the graphics thread, which is separate from the
    UI thread, and it was noticed that somehow the error handler would be
    overwritten almost seemingly at random, indicating that something else
    in the program outside of OBS code was not locking the display while
    pushing/popping the error handler.
    
    To replicate this, make it so that the source cannot find the target
    window and so it continually searches for it each video_tick call, then
    resize the main OBS window continually (which causes Qt to push/pop its
    own error handlers).  A crash will almost always occur due to BadWindow
    despite our error handling.
    
    2.) Calling X functions with a window ID that no longer exists,
    particularly XGetWindowAttributes, in conjunction the unknown error
    handler set in case #1 would cause the program to outright crash because
    that error handler is programmed to crash on BadWindow for whatever
    reason.  The source would call X functions without even checking if
    'win' was 0.
    
    3.) The source stored window IDs (in JSON, even if they've long since
    become invalid/pointless, such as system restarts).  This is a bad
    practice and will result in more cases of BadWindow.
    
    Fixing the problem (reducing the possibility of getting BadWindow):
    -------------------------------
    Step 1.) Deprecate and ignore window IDs in stored settings.  Instead of
    using window IDs to find the window, we now must always search the
    windows and find the target window via the window name exclusively.
    This helps ensure that we actually consistently have a working window
    ID.
    
    Step 2.) Do not call any X functions if the window ID is 0.
    
    Step 3.) Reset the window ID to 0 any time the window has updated, and
    make the source find the window again to ensure it still exists before
    attempting to use any X functions on the window ID again.

    libobs: Fix bug activating/showing transitions in a tree
    
    When a transition is a sub-source of another source, it would not call
    the transition's active source enum function, meaning that any sources
    the transition had would not increment their active/showing refs (it
    would only be called when activating the transition directly before).
    That would result in negative/invalid active/showing refs on its
    sub-sources, causing them to become permanently active/inactive and/or
    permanently showing/hidden.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix NVENC lossless mode
    
    Lossless mode is set through the preset setting, and the profile ffmpeg
    setting was incorrectly being set as lossless instead.

    Revert "win-capture: Allow window capturing of current process"
    
    This reverts commit 8d520b970d3552417005f6dab4f0892485cd14ce.
    
    This can actually cause a hard lock due to the windows API when
    destroying window capture.  When the graphics thread locks the source
    list for doing tick or render, and then the UI thread tries to destroy a
    source, the UI thread will wait for the graphics thread to complete
    rendering/ticking of sources.  The video_tick of window capture would
    then check windows in the same process and try to query the window's
    name via GetWindowText.  However, GetWindowText is synchronous, and will
    not return until the window event has been processed by the UI thread,
    so it will perpetually lock because the two threads are waiting for each
    other to finish.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix ffmpeg-mux unicode file saving (win32)
    
    On windows, if you were saving a file name or directory with characters
    that are not of the current windows character set, it could cause the
    file saving process to fail.  This fixes it so that on windows it uses
    wmain and converts the unicode command line to a UTF-8 command line,
    which works with FFmpeg.

    capture that same window.

    UI: Use defaults when changing to different encoders
    
    In the advanced output section of settings, when a different encoder is
    set, it would try to pass over settings from the other encoder, which
    may or may not be fully compatible with different encoders.  Instead,
    just set it to defaults if it's on an encoder that's different from the
    currently loaded encoder.

    The "cbr" setting has been deprecated, so if the user is using that
    setting for any of the encoders, convert it to set "rate_control" to
    "CBR".
    
    Additionally, if an encoder is using x264 with VBR and the buffer size
    is set to 0, change the rate control mode to CRF.

    UI: Use CQP for NVENC when using simple output mode
    
    When using simple output mode, previously NVENC did not support a
    constant quality rate control method, and you'd have to use VBR with
    bitrate.  However CQP has since been added to NVENC, and it's preferable
    to use for recording when available instead of using VBR.

    "rate_control" parameter that sets the rate control method, which can be
    one of the following: CBR, ABR, VBR, CRF.
    
    If the "cbr" setting is used, it will throw a deprecation warning to the

    methods: VBR, CBR, CQP, Lossless.
    
    This moves lossless from being a preset to being a rate control method.

    UI: Fix bug where transition refs would not release
    
    When clicking the transition properties button and creating the
    context menu with properties/rename, it would create actions that also
    included a source reference, but the parent of those actions was the
    main window instead of the menu, so those actions would stay created
    until the main window was destroyed.
    
    This would cause bugs with saving/loading scenes where children of that
    transition would also be perpetually referenced.
    
    So instead of using the main window, just use a pointer to the menu
    itself as the parent so that when the menu is destroyed, the actions are
    also destroyed, and the source refs released.

    libobs: Don't prematurely stop transition audio
    
    Transition audio was programmed to stop if there is no queued audio from
    both sources.  Because of that, when a source's audio started after the
    transition started, it would cause audio from the source to be excluded
    from the transition until the transition had completed because the audio
    had already been marked as stopped.
    
    Instead, if there's no audio from the transition sources, the audio
    should only be marked as stopped when video has stopped.  This allows
    the to/from sources to have an opportunity to start/restart audio during
    the transition safely.

    These should have been fixed macros from the beginning.

    obs-filters: Fix more chroma key shader code
    
    In aa4e18740a219b I mistakenly thought that I could add the variables
    back in and that it would automatically cull variables that aren't used,
    but that wasn't the case -- the shader parser always checks to see
    whether parameters were set, and if they're not, it'll fail.  This fixes
    an issue where the shader would try to access parameters that are no
    longer needed and fail due to the shader parameter check.
    
    YUV-based shader support has been removed (due to the fact that no
    sources ever use YUV shading) so there's no reason to keep around the
    YUV processing code.

    UI: Show warning if using multiple separate QSV encoders
    
    Warns users that two separate QSV encoders can't be active at the same
    time.
    
    This should be considered a temporary solution to two issues:
    1.) Encoders need to be able to report these errors themselves
    2.) If the QSV encoder is ever changed to allow more than one encoder at
        the same time this should be removed

    obs-qsv11: Prevent more than one active QSV encoders
    
    Currently, multiple QSV encoders cannot be active at the same time
    (otherwise it will crash).  This is a temporary solution to prevent
    crashes from occurring when more than one QSV encoder tries to start up
    at the same time.
    
    Additionally, in the future there should be a way for encoders to be
    able to communicate with the front-end when an error such as this
    occurs.

    obs-filters: Fix scroll filter offsets becoming non-finite
    
    If the parent source of a scroll filter has a 0 width or 0 height, the
    scroll filter would do a division by zero on the size_i variable, which
    would then cause the offset variable to perpetually have a non-finite
    value, thus preventing the scroll filter from rendering properly after
    that due to the non-finite offset value being uploaded to the shader.

    3. After a while of high cpu usage, it crashed. Seems reproduced more
    easily on faster computer

    libobs: Don't use was_down for hotkey detection
    
    From MSDN: "The behavior of the least significant bit of the return value
    is retained strictly for compatibility with 16-bit Windows applications
    (which are non-preemptive) and should not be relied upon."
    
    This caused problems with hotkeys firing if the user pressed a hotkey key
    in another application, followed by the modifier keys at any other time.
    OBS would then think the hotkey key was just pressed based on the was_down
    behavior and incorrectly trigger a hotkey event.
    
    Fixes 0000443.

    There's no need to duplicate the packet as the reference count will be 1

    stack-based temporary packet which is then double-freed by the decoder
    thread.

    obs-qsv11: Fix win7 crash when fake monitor isn't forced
    
    When using QSV is used on a windows 7 machine with a dedicated card, you
    have to fake a monitor connection to your Intel graphics to be able to
    use QSV.  If you do not, the initialization will fail with an error.
    The error for that situation is not handled properly, and a variable
    will be used while null.  Instead, the function should safely return
    after that error is received.
    
    Also, do not call ClearData in the destructor unless QSV has been
    properly initialized (if m_pmfxENC is null).

    libobs: Fix another sync issue with encoder sharing
    
    If audio buffering is very high, the audio packets built up in the
    interleaved buffer would be significantly before the first video packet,
    causing the offset between the starting video/audio packet pairs to be
    significantly off, leading to desync.
    
    This issue was not spotted until recently because it only happens when

    win-capture: Fix case where hook only captures one frame
    
    When using a chain hook method (forward or reverse), it was unwisely
    assumed that the previous hook in the chain would not overwrite new
    hooks when it's called.  When the game capture hook calls the previous
    hook in the chain, certain other programs that hook (in this case,
    rivatuner on-screen display) would overwrite the hook with older data
    and erase the game capture hook, causing it to only capture the first
    frame and then never capture again.
    
    This patch ensures that the hook is always saved before calling the next
    hook in the chain and then restored after the call returns.  It also
    preserves any new hooks that may be added on top of it at any point.

    avformat_free_context() only frees the memory used by an AVFormatContext
    but it does not close the opened media file. This causes a leaked file
    descriptor every time a media source frees a demuxer. Using
    avformat_close_input() instead frees the context and closes the media

    libobs: Mark filters as private (band-aid fix)
    
    This patch fixes a specific crash where if the user named a filter the
    same name as an input source that already existed in the system, scene
    item loading code could find the filter with the same name instead of
    the source, and mistakenly use it as the scene item's source directly.
    This would cause a crash when trying to render that filter as a regular
    source.
    
    Marking filters as private is a temporary and simple workaround to the
    solution.  Filters are currently not meant to be found via the main
    enumeration/search functions, which is a design flaw (lack of
    consistency).  In future major API revisions of libobs, filters should
    be reworked to act as sources, with the sources they filter as
    sub-sources ideally.
    
    Additionally, the concept of "private context objects" and "primary
    lists of context objects" in the back-end should probably also be
    removed, allowing the font-end (or optional separate API layers) to
    control all primary lists of obs context objects.  These minor issues
    that occur ultimately stem from API design flaws which need to be
    corrected.

    This crash happened when a filter was mistakenly used as a regular

    The filter and the source it belongs to both had the same names, and the
    source loading code found the filter and mistakenly used it as the
    source instead of the actual source with the same name.

    UI: Add GenerateSpecifiedFilename function
    
    Maps specifiers and accepts ones that work across multiple OSes.
    
    On some systems, depending on locale, the specifier may resolve to an
    empty string or nothing.  GenerateSpecifiedFilename will avoid
    conversion of the specifier if this happens, to help guard against this.

    image-source: Fix reloading bug when stat fails
    
    (Note: This commit also modified text-freetype2)
    
    The implementation of get_modified_timestamp() did not check the return
    value of stat(), so in case the check fails the values in the stats
    structure can be any garbage on the stack and the value of
    stats.st_mtime can change on every call. This can trigger a reload of
    the image every second, even if the file was not actually modified.

    UI: Add deinterlacing to UI
    
    Accessible via the context menu of a source.

commit 07c644c5813f60d46a6e69d387e2697c23958c72

    libobs: Add deinterlacing API functions
    
    Adds deinterlacing API functions.  Both standard and 2x variants are
    supported.  Deinterlacing is set via obs_source_set_deinterlace_mode and
    obs_source_set_deinterlace_field_order.
    
    This was implemented in to the core itself because deinterlacing should
    happen before effect filters are processed, but after async filters are
    processed.  If this were added as a filter, there is the possibility
    that a different filter is processed before deinterlacing, which could
    mess with the result.  It was also a bit easier to implement this way
    due to the fact that that deinterlacing may need to have access to the
    previous async frame.
    
    Effects were split in to separate files to reduce load time (especially
    for yadif shaders which take a significant amount of time to compile).

    libobs: Update async textures via function parameters
    
    Instead of just updating the async texture variables directly in the
    source, allow the ability to pass the async texture variables via
    function parameters to allow the ability to parse more than one frame to
    more than one texture.
    
    This code is primarily intended to be used to upload/convert the
    "previous" async frame for the deinterlacer (if necessary).

    (Note: This commit also modifies obs-filters and text-freetype2)
    
    This simplifies writing of effects.  DrawMatrix is no longer necessary
    because there are no sources that require drawing with a color matrix
    other than async sources, and async sources are automatically processed
    and don't defer their initial render stage to filters.

    This is a fast/immediate solution to a possible bug with caching the DLL

    just to be safe.  Load time will increase a little for the time being
    but it's worth it to prevent any issues with game capture.

    (API Change) libobs: Don't use signal for obs_load_sources
    
    (Note: This commit also changes the UI)
    
    Changed:
    -------------------
    void obs_load_sources(obs_data_array_t *sources_list);
    
    To:
    -------------------
    void obs_load_sources(obs_data_array_t *sources_list,
                    obs_source_load_cb callback, void *private_data);
    
    Signals should really never be required to use to make some function
    work properly.  The "source_load" signal was required for the
    obs_load_sources function, but it's meant more for loading private data
    in the settings, not for general loading of sources.
    
    This changes it so that a callback is explicitly required to load the
    sources.

    UI: Unify output record paths across setting dialogs

    UI: Unify output record paths across setting dialogs
    
    It seems more intuitive if the recording paths for the Simple
    Output, Advanced Default Output and Advanced FFmpeg Output are
    linked together, so that the user does not have to manage three
    paths if switching between the different options.
    
    The UI elements are also connected so that a change to one
    signals a change to the others with the corresponding config
    setting.

    libobs: Fix an issue that would cause audio stuttering
    
    Under certain circumstances, the timing_adjust variable would cause line
    1161 to continually trigger over and over again.  The "loop detection"
    code incorrectly made it so that any timestamp that was just simply
    below the expected value would be seen as a jump.  After that, the
    timing_adjust variable would be set for the frame again, and then the
    audio would see it as a jump again after that, and those two things
    would continue endlessly.  This would cause stuttering particularly with
    certain devices (particularly elgato/lgp/hdpvr) where the audio/video
    data are decoded and sent at varying/different/unpredictable times.
    
    To fix this issue, it should not detect values below as jumps, but
    instead should only do it for values that exceed the MAX_TS_VAR (maximum
    timestamp variance) value.

    UI: Use uncompressed audio for lossless
    
    Originally there was an issue using FLAC for audio in AVI files, AVI
    files wouldn't play back with some players.  Because FLAC doesn't work,
    and lossless should be lossless, instead just used uncompressed WAV
    data for the lossless audio, which is always supported.

    FLAC doesn't work properly in AVI files, and MKV files don't work in
    vegas.  So, sadly the only solution is to use lossless audio at a super
    high bitrate for the time being.

    libobs: Fix bug where source audio could stop outputting
    
    If obs_source::audio_ts is set to 0 (such as by discard_if_stopped in
    obs-audio.c), but the push_back variable in the source_output_audio_data
    function in obs-source.c was being set to true (meaning it's within the
    seamless audio smoothing threshold), it would cause it to never reset
    the obs_source::audio_ts value, and thus all audio data from the source
    would become perpetually ignored by the audio subsystem until there was
    finally some sort of timestamp jump that caused it to call
    source_output_audio_place, and thus reset obs_source::audio_ts.
    
    obs_source::audio_ts is only reset in source_output_audio_place, not in
    source_output_audio_push_back, so the most simple solution is to just
    call source_output_audio_push_back is obs_source::audio_ts is 0.

    purpose if the source's audio has actually stopped.

    This variable is used to detect whether audio has stopped -- if audio
    stops, it detects that no new data is coming in, and resets the audio
    position so that it eliminates the chance of causing the audio buffering
    to go haywire if audio starts up again.  However, this variable was not
    being reset every time the value changes, which it should.

    in their timestamps, and the calculation of where to start the audio
    data for one of the sources could be above the tick size, which could
    cause a crash.

    libobs: Discard remainder audio if source audio stopped
    
    If the circular audio buffer of the source has data remaining that's
    less than the audio frame tick count (1024 frames), it would just leave
    that audio data on the source without discarding it.  However, this
    could cause audio buffering to increase unnecessarily under certain
    circumstances (when the next audio timestamp is within the timestamp
    jump window), so it would append data to that circular buffer despite
    the audio stopping that long ago, causing audio buffering to have to
    increase to compensate.
    
    Instead, just discard pending audio if it hasn't been written to.  In
    other words, if the audio has stopped and there's insufficient audio
    left to continue processing.

    libobs: Ensure paired encoders start up at the same time
    
    With the new audio subsystem, audio buffering is minimal at all times.
    However, when the audio buffering is too small or non-existent, it would
    cause the audio encoders to start with a timestamp that was actually
    higher than the first video frame timestamp.  Video would have some
    inherent buffering/delay, but then audio could return and encode almost
    immediately.  This created a possible window of empty time between the
    first encoded video packet and the first encoded audio packet, where as
    audio buffering would cause the first audio packet's timestamp to always
    be way before the first video packet's timestamp.  It would then
    incorrectly assume the two starting points were in sync.
    
    So instead of assuming the audio data is always first, this patch makes
    video wait for audio data comes in, and conversely buffers audio data
    until video comes in, and tries to find a starting point within that
    video data instead, ensuring a synced starting point whether audio
    buffering is active or not.

    libobs: Try to pair video with one multi-track encoders
    
    When starting a multi-track output, attempt to pair the video encoder
    with one of the audio encoders to ensure that the video and audio
    encoders start as close together in time as possible.  This ensures the
    best possible audio/video syncing point when using multi-track audio
    output.

    libobs: Start audio tracks before starting video tracks
    
    When using multi-track audio, encoders cannot be paired like they can
    when only using a single audio track with video, so it has to choose the
    best point in the interleaved buffer as the "starting point", and if the
    encoders start up at different times, it has to prune that data and wait
    to start the output on the next video keyframe.  When the audio encoders
    started up, there was the case where the encoders would take some time
    to load, and it would cause the pruning code to wait for the next
    keyframe to ensure startup syncing.
    
    Starting the audio encoders before starting the video encoder should
    reduce the possibility of that happening in a multi-track scenario.

    libobs: Consider multi-track audio when pruning packets
    
    In a multi-track scenario it was not taking in to consideration the
    possibility of secondary audio tracks, which could have caused desync on
    some of the audio tracks.

    libobs: Remove seamless audio loop handling
    
    The seamless audio looping code would erroneously trigger for things
    that weren't loops, causing the audio data to continually push back and
    ignore timestamps, thus going out of sync.
    
    There does need to be loop handling code, but due to the fact that other
    things may need to trigger this code, it's best just to clear the audio
    data and start from a fresh sync point.  Unfortunately for the case of
    loops, this means the window in which audio data loops and video frames
    loop need to be muted.

    Fixes an issue where audio data would not be popped if they were not

    sources (excuding composite/filter sources) helps ensure that audio data
    is always popped and not left to pile up.

    UI: Implement transitions and preview/program mode
    
    Implements transitions, and introduces "Studio Mode" which allows live
    editing of the same or different scenes while preserving what's
    currently being displayed.
    
    Studio Mode offers a number of new features:
      - The ability to edit different scenes or the same scene without
        modifying what's currently being displayed (of course)
    
      - The ability to set up "quick transitions" with a desired transition
        and duration that can be assigned hotkeys
    
      - The option to create full copies of all sources in the program scene
        to allow editing of source properties of the same scene live without
        modifying the output, or (by default) just use references.  (Note
        however that certain sources cannot be duplicated, such as capture
        sources, media sources, and device sources)
    
      - Swap Mode (enabled by default) which swaps the program scene with
        the preview scene when a transition completes
    
    Currently, only non-configurable transitions (transitions without
    properties) are listed, and the only transitions available as of this
    writing are fade and cut.  In future versions more transitions will be
    added, such as swipe, stingers, and many other various sort of
    transitions, and the UI will support being able to add/configure/remove
    those sort of configurable transitions.

    libobs: Fix audio issues with async video/audio looping
    
    This fixes an age-old issue where audio samples could be lost or audio
    could temporarily go out of sync in the case of looping videos.  When
    audio/video data is looping, there's a window between when the audio
    data resets its timestamp value and when the video data resets its
    timestamp value.  This method simply pushes back the audio data while in
    that window and does not modify sync, and when it detects that its out
    of the loop window it simply forces a resync of the audio data in the
    circular buffer.
    
    This ensures that minimal audio data is lost in the loop process, and
    minimizes the likelihood of any sort of sync issues associated with
    looping.

    system timestamps.  This fixes an issue where if audio timestamps reset
    to 0 (for whatever reason), the offset would cause the timestamp to go
    in to the negative.

    audio from being allocated every time these functions are called due to
    the calldata structure.

    libobs: Implement transition sources
    
    Transition sources are implemented by registering a source type as
    OBS_SOURCE_TYPE_TRANSITION.  They're automatically marked as video
    composite sources, and video_render/audio_render callbacks must be set
    when registering the source.  get_width and get_height callbacks are
    unused for these types of sources, as transitions automatically handle
    width/height behind the scenes with the transition settings.
    
    In the video_render callback, the helper function
    obs_transition_video_render is used to assist in automatically
    processing and rendering the audio.  A render callback is passed to the
    function, which in turn passes to/from textures that are automatically
    rendered in the back-end.
    
    Similarly, in the audio_render callback, the helper function
    obs_transition_audio_render is used to assist in automatically
    processing and rendering the audio.  Two mix callbacks are used to
    handle how the source/destination sources are mixed together.  To ensure
    the best possible quality, audio processing is per-sample.
    
    Transitions can be set to automatically resize, or they can be set to
    have a fixed size.  Sources within transitions can be made to scale to
    the transition size (with or without aspect ratio), or to not scale
    unless they're bigger than the transition.  They can have a specific
    alignment within the transition, or they just default to top-left.
    These features are implemented for the purpose of extending transitions
    to also act as "switch" sources later, where you can switch to/from two
    different sources using the transition animation.
    
    Planned (but not yet implemented and lower priority) features:
    
    - "Switch" transitions which allow the ability to switch back and forth
      between two sources with a transitioning animation without discarding
      the references
    
    - Easing options to allow the option to transition with a bezier or
      custom curve
    
    - Manual transitioning to allow the front-end/user to manually control
      the transition offset

    Prevents a mutual lock with the scene mutex and graphics mutex.  In

    scene mutexes second, while in the UI thread, the scene mutexes could be
    locked first, then when a scene item is being destroyed, a source could
    be destroyed, and sometimes sources would lock the graphics mutex
    second.
    
    A possible additional solution is to defer source destroys to the video
    thread.

    libobs: Implement new audio subsystem
    
    The new audio subsystem fixes two issues:
    
    - First Primary issue it fixes is the ability for parent sources to
      intercept the audio of child sources, and do custom processing on
      them.  The main reason for this was the ability to do custom
      cross-fading in transitions, but it's also useful for things such as
      side-chain effects, applying audio effects to entire scenes, applying
      scene-specific audio filters on sub-sources, and other such
      possibilities.
    
    - The secondary issue that needed fixing was audio buffering.
      Previously, audio buffering was always a fixed buffer size, so it
      would always have exactly a certain number of milliseconds of audio
      buffering (and thus output delay).  Instead, it now dynamically
      increases audio buffering only as necessary, minimizing output delay,
      and removing the need for users to have to worry about an audio
      buffering setting.
    
    The new design makes it so that audio from the leaves of the scene graph
    flow to the root nodes, and can be intercepted by parent sources.  Each
    audio source handles its own buffering, and each audio tick a specific
    number of audio frames are popped from the front of the circular buffer
    on each audio source.  Composite sources (such as scenes) can access the
    audio for child sources and do custom processing or mixing on that
    audio.  Composite sources use the audio_render callback of sources to do
    synchronous or deferred audio processing per audio tick.  Things like
    scenes now mix audio from their sub-sources.

    libobs: Implement composite sources (skip)
    
    (Note: This commit breaks libobs compilation.  Skip if bisecting)
    
    Adds a "composite" source type which is used for sources that composite
    one or more sub-sources.  The audio_render callback is called for
    composite sources to allow those types of sources to do custom
    processing of the audio of its sub-sources.

    win-capture: Add game capture fix for darkest dungeon
    
    Darkest dungeon uses an unusual technique for drawing its frames: a
    fixed 1920x1080 frame buffer used in place of the backbuffer, which is
    then stretched to fit the size of the screen (whether the screen is
    bigger or smaller than the actual texture).
    
    The custom frame would cause glReadBuffer to initially fail with an
    error.  When this happens, their custom frame buffer is in use, so all
    that needs to be done is simply reset the capture and force the current
    output size to 1920x1080 while that custom frame is in use.
    
    They presumably did this in order to ensure the game looks the same at
    any resolution.  Instead of having to use power-of-two sprites and
    mipmaps for every single game sprite and stretch/skew each of them
    (which would risk the final output "not looking quite right" at
    different resolutions), they simply use non-pow-2 sprites with no
    mipmaps and render them all on to one texture of a fixed size and then
    stretch that final output texture.  That ensures that the actual
    composite of the game still looks the same at any resolution, while
    reducing texture memory by not requiring each sprite to use a
    power-of-two texture and mipmaps.

    obs-ffmpeg: Add "restart when active" media source property
    
    Adds the option of making the media file restart when the source becomes
    active (such as switching to a scene with it).
    
    Due to lack of libff features to start/stop/pause/seek media files,
    currently this just destroys the demuxer and recreates it.  Ideally,
    libff should have some functions to allow a more optimal means of doing
    those things.

    Reactors a bit of code related to starting up FFmpeg and makes it so the

    Instead of the media source properties showing the URL mode by default
    along with a whole bunch of properties that are confusing to most users,
    starts on file mode and changes defaults to be a bit more sensible
    related to file input.
    
    Also, as a temporary measure for fixing color format issues (some video
    files would display their color information incorrectly), forced format
    conversion is now enabled by default, and has been moved to advanced
    settings.  Ideally, the actual bug causing color format issues in either
    media-io or libff should be fixed at some point.

    have to wade through non-media files just to select a media file.  A
    filter to show all files is still available as well.

    UI: Disable OSX V-Sync when program is open
    
    OSX has an annoying feature called "BeamSync", which on later versions
    of OSX is always on.  For whatever reason, Apple devs decided to force
    this feature to always be on, so applications must always render with
    v-sync regardless of what they set their swap interval to.
    
    This issue would cause syncing to the vertical refresh for each
    additional active display, and wouldn't allow rendering above the
    current refresh rate.  This caused major rendering stalls and prevented
    video frame timing from being accurate.
    
    This fixes the issue by using an undocumented set of functions to
    disable BeamSync.  Note that because this is an undocumented method of
    working around the issue, its existence cannot be guaranteed.  If the
    functions no longer exist for whatever reason, it will safely do
    nothing.

    libobs: Fix potential output audio/video sync bug
    
    Problem:
    
    When an output is started with encoders that have already been started
    by another output, and it starts in between the window in between where
    the first audio packets start coming in and where the first video packet
    comes in, the output would get audio packets with timestamps potentially
    much later than the first video frame when the first video frame finally
    comes in.  The audio/video encoders will almost always have a differing
    delay.
    
    Solution:
    
    Detect that starting window, and if within that starting window, wait
    for a new keyframe from video instead of trying to sync up video.
    
    Additional Notes:
    
    In these cases where an output starts with already-active encoders, this
    patch also reduces the potential sync offset between the first video
    frame and the first audio frame.  Before, it would sync the first video
    frame with the first audio frames right after that, but now it syncs
    with the closest audio frame in the interleaved array, which halves the
    potential sync difference between the first video frame and the first

    libobs: Subtract packet dts_usec with first packet offset
    
    Ensures that the packet dts_usec vals which are generated for
    syncing/interleaving use the proper offset relative to where they're
    supposed to be starting from.  The negative DTS of a first video packet
    could potentially have been applied twice due to this.

    libobs/callback: Allow ability to use calldata_t with stack
    
    Allows the ability to use fixed stack memory to construct a calldata_t
    structure rather than having to allocate each time.  This is fine to do
    for certain signals where the calldata never goes above a specific size.
    If by some chance the size is insufficient, it will output a log
    message.

    just that: only call the recursive height/width functions if it's not a

    (API Change) libobs: Rename funcs relating to active child sources
    
    Renames:
    ----------------------------------------
    obs_source_add_child
    obs_source_remove_child
    obs_source_enum_sources
    obs_source_enum_tree
    obs_source_info::enum_sources

    ----------------------------------------
    obs_source_add_active_child
    obs_source_remove_active_child
    obs_source_enum_active_sources
    obs_source_enum_active_tree
    obs_source_info::enum_active_sources
    
    These functions/callbacks had misleading names: they originally implied
    any child sources, when they actually meant active child sources that
    are being used to render video or audio.  It's important that the
    function names represent their actual purpose.

    The concept of "user sources" is flawed: it was something that the

    saving/loading, and often it had to code around it.  That's not how
    saving/loading should work, a front-end should be allowed to manage
    lists of sources in the way it explicitly chooses, and it should be able
    to choose which sources it wants to save/load.

    obs-filters: Reset cx/cy/mul/add crop vals in tick, not render
    
    To first render the filter, the width/height values must be set, but
    currently they're only set in the render function, which means that the
    crop filter can never be rendered when the program first starts up.
    This would cause the filter to fail to render at all under those
    circumstances.
    
    This patch moves the calculations from render to tick to ensure that
    they're always called and the values are always set.

    will cause a crash if used.  Instead, just hook Reset/ResetEx when one
    of the Present* functions are called.

    obs-outputs: Stop in thread to prevent locking UI
    
    Sometimes stopping a connection can lock up due to data that still
    remains to be sent, and this would lock up the thread requesting the
    stop (typically the UI thread).  So instead of locking up the calling
    thread, spawn a new thread specifically for stopping so the calling
    thread can continue uninterrupted.  If the user attempts to reconnect,
    it will wait for the stop thread to complete in the connect thread
    before attempting to connect.

    UI: Move properties window creation for new sources
    
    Currently creating new sources can cause a deadlock:
    OBSBasicSourceSelect locks the scene mutex when adding a new source
    (required to add invisible sources), and later OBSBasic tries to
    lock the graphics mutex (via CreatePropertiesWindow); meanwhile the
    graphics thread is holding the graphics mutex and tries to lock each
    scene as it renders them, resulting in a (non-obvious from the code)
    lock ordering conflict.
    
    Moving the CreatePropertiesWindow call out of the locked scene mutex
    restores the previous lock ordering; in addition, the requirement
    for keeping sourceSceneRefs for opening that initial properties
    window is removed

    libobs: Update async video texture before effect filters
    
    When an async video source is about to be rendered, the async texture
    should be updated before any effect filtering occurs, rather than right
    when it's about to render.
    
    Fixes a few bugs:
    
    - If the async texture hadn't drawn for its first time, and the source
      has an effect filter, it would never end up rendering the first
      frame due to the fact that it would fail on obs-source.c:2434 for the
      first filter, causing it to never actually render the source, and thus
      never get to a point in which it could call set_async_texture_size to
      establish the async texture width/height for the first time.
    
    - Any time the async texture size changed, it would only update the
      async texture size at the end of the filter loop, which means that the
      first frame after a size change would use the old size for the filters
      rather than update to the new size right away.

    text-freetype2: Fix garbled rendering if face changed
    
    When using a text file with the source and the font face is changed, it
    would cause it to fail to update the glyphs and text accordingly.  It
    would trigger an error jump at line 392 of text-freetype2.c, ultimately
    resulting in the text to render garbled after that.
    
    How to reproduce:
    Set the source to get text from a file, then just change the font face
    (but not the size or anything else).

    text-freetype2: Refresh glype cache after file update
    
    When updating text from file periodically, newer glyphs that weren't
    already cached would not end up being rendered.  This fixes the issue by
    calling cache_glyphs after the file has been updated.
    
    How to reproduce the original issue:
    Set a text-freetype2 source to load an english-only text file.  Then
    overwrite the text in the file with non-english characters.  The
    non-english characters will then fail to render.

    libobs: Always use CRLF for crash text
    
    When the crash text is generated, it's generated with LF line endings

    on windows (due to the fact that notepad still to this day has not been
    programmed to understand anything other than CRLF).  Instead of using
    LF, just use CRLF.

    win-wasapi: Use system timestamps by default for input
    
    Microphones and other input devices can often have bad or erroneous
    timestamps.  Although we handle bad timestamps much better in
    obs-studio, there are still lingering issues that can crop up from time
    to time with device QPC timestamps that leads to mic data not playing
    back properly.  It's best if it be off by default rather than on, which
    will now cause it to use system timestamps for input devices by default.
    This changes it to the same handling as OBS1 for this case.

    UI: Fix removing wrong scene from list
    
    RemoveScene would always remove the currently selected item from the
    scenes list, even if that item didn't reference the actual scene being
    removed; finding the proper item via its OBSRef fixes this issue.
    
    How to reproduce the original issue:
    Create two scenes "a" and "b", set a hotkey for switching to scene "a",
    select scene "b" and press the remove scene button, then while the
    confirmation dialog is up press the hotkey while the UI is out of focus.
    The active scene should have switched to "a", while the dialog still
    displays "b" as its target; now confirm the removal of "b". Note how "a"
    was removed from the scenes list instead.

    This reverts commit 35b2ce565a2b90909e2b94da5f28de4bb3a87ff0.
    
    There is far too much potential for issues to occur if the first-time
    start creates a display capture by default on linux and windows.
    Display capture on windows laptops will not be guaranteed to capture
    properly, leaving the user with a blank screen.  Display capture on
    linux downloads its image off the graphics processor, so it's quite
    inefficient to have on by default.

    UI: Add recording presets to simple output
    
    So certain high-profile individuals were complaining that it was
    difficult to configure recording settings for quality in OBS.  So, I
    decided to add a very easy-to-use auto-configuration for high quality
    encoding -- including lossless encoding.  This feature will
    automatically configure ideal recording settings based upon a specified
    quality level.
    
    Recording quality presets added to simple output:
    
    - Same as stream: Copies the encoded streaming data with no extra usage
      hit.
    
    - High quality: uses a higher CRF value (starting at 23) if using x264.
    
    - Indistinguishable quality: uses a low CRF value (starting at 16) if
      using x264.
    
    - Lossless will spawn an FFmpeg output that uses huffyuv encoding.  If a
      user tries to select lossless, they will be warned both via a dialog
      prompt and a warning message in the settings window to ensure they
      understand that it requires tremendous amounts of free space.  It will
      always use the AVI file format.
    
    Extra Notes:
    
    - When High/Indistinguishable quality is set, it will allow you to
      select the recording encoder.  Currently, it just allows you to select
      x264 (at either veryfast or ultrafast).  Later on, it'll be useful to
      be able to set up pre-configured presets for hardware encoders once
      more are implemented and tested.
    
    - I decided to allow the use of x264 at both veryfast or ultrafast
      presets.  The reasoning is two-fold:
    
      1.) ultrafast is perfectly viable even for near indistinguishable
    quality as long as it has the appropriate CRF value.  It's nice if you
    want to record but would like to or need to reduce the impact of
    encoding on the CPU.  It will automatically compensate for the preset at
    the cost of larger file size.
    
      2.) It was suggested to just always use ultrafast, but ultrafast
    requires 2-4x as much disk space for the same CRF (most likely due to
    x264 compensating for the preset).  Providing veryfast is important if
    you really want to reduce file size and/or reduce blocking at lower
    quality levels.
    
    - When a recording preset is used, a secondary audio encoder is also
      spawned at 192 bitrate to ensure high quality audio.  I chose 192
      because that's the limit of the media foundation aac encoder on
      windows, which I want to make sure is used if available due to its
      high performance.
    
    - The CRF calculation is based upon resolution, quality, and whether
      it's set to ultrafast.  First, quality sets the base CRF, 23 for
      "good" quality, 16 for "very high" quality.  If set to ultrafast,
      it'll subtract 2 points from the CRF value to help compensate.  Lower
      resolutions will also lower the CRF value to help improve higher
      details with a smaller pixel ratio.

    win-capture: Always have some capture FPS limit
    
    For game capture, if a game is running at for example 800 FPS and limit
    capture framerate is off, it would try to capture all 800 of those
    frames, dramatically reducing performance more than what would ever be
    necessary.
    
    When limit capture framerate is off, instead of capturing all frames,
    capture frames at an interval of twice the OBS FPS, identical to how
    OBS1 works by default.  This should greatly increase performance under
    that circumstance.

    obs-ffmpeg: Do not require encoder ids to be set
    
    For the FFmpeg output, the encoder ids are sort of superfluous.  They
    really should be optional.  If they're not set, it should use the
    encoder name string instead to determine the ids automatically.

    win-mf: Do not register encoder if it can't create
    
    It seems that certain encoders (quicksync) do not have proper back-end
    support in the windows media foundation libraries for certain CPUs.
    Quicksync doesn't appear to support CPUs that are not haswell (4xxx) or
    above.  It's really annoying, but there's not much we can do about it
    until we implement our own custom quicksync implementation.
    
    This check simply makes it attempt to spawn an encoder to check to see
    whether the encoder can actually be created before registering an
    encoder.

    win-mf: Fix more issues on encoder shutdown
    
    The previous commit (672378d20) was supposed to fix issues with the
    encoder releasing while data was still being processed, but did not
    account for when the encoder has never started up.  That was my fault.
    
    Furthermore, the way in which it was waiting to drain events was
    incorrect.  The encoder may still be active even though there aren't any
    events queued.  The proper way to wait for an async encoder to finish up
    is to process output samples until it requests more input samples.

    win-mf: Drain events before releasing encoder
    
    After I made it so that the encoder internal data gets destroyed when
    all outputs stop using it (fa7286f8), the media foundation h264 encoder
    started having crashes on shutdown.  After a lot of testing, I realized
    that the reason it started happening is almost assuredly because active
    encoding events had not yet been completed.
    
    After making it wait on those events by calling DrainEvents(true), the
    crashes stopped.  So asynchronous actions were clearly still occurring
    and it was shutting down while data was still being processed, thus
    leading to a crash.

    mac-vth264: Add Apple H264 encoder
    
    Adds a VideoToolbox based H264 encoder for OSX, which most notably
    allows the use of hardware encoding (Quicksync).
    
    NOTES:
    - Hardware encoding is handled by Apple itself internally.  The plugin
      itself has little control over many details due to the way that Apple
      designed the VideoToolbox interface.  Generally however, quicksync is
      used if available on the CPU, and quicksync is almost always available
      due to the fact that macs are exclusively Intel.
    
    - The VideoToolbox does not seem to implement CBR, so it won't be
      available.  These encoders are generally not recommended for
      streaming.

    win-mf: Add media foundation h264 encoder
    
    Implements hardware encoders through the Media Foundation interface
    provided by Microsoft.
    
    Supports:
    - Quicksync (Intel)
    - VCE (AMD)
    - NVENC (NVIDIA, might only be supported through MF on Windows 10)
    
    Notes:
    - NVENC and VCE do not appear to have proper CBR implementations.  This
      isn't a fault of our code, but the Media Foundation libraries.
      Quicksync however appears to be fine.

    (API Change) libobs: Pass type data to get_name callbacks
    
    API changed from:
    obs_source_info::get_name(void)
    obs_output_info::get_name(void)
    obs_encoder_info::get_name(void)
    obs_service_info::get_name(void)
    
    API changed to:
    obs_source_info::get_name(void *type_data)
    obs_output_info::get_name(void *type_data)
    obs_encoder_info::get_name(void *type_data)
    obs_service_info::get_name(void *type_data)
    
    This allows the type data to be used when getting the name of the
    object (useful for plugin wrappers primarily).
    
    NOTE: Though a parameter was added, this is backward-compatible with
    older plugins due to calling convention.  The new parameter will simply
    be ignored by older plugins, and the stack (if used) will be cleaned up
    by the caller.

    libobs: Shut down encoder when not in use
    
    This prevents encoders (hardware encoders in particular) from being
    continually active when all outputs disconnect from an encoder.  This is
    mostly just a temporary measure; the encoding interface may need a bit
    of a redesign.  It will also definitely needs to be able to flush at
    some point.  Currently when an output is stopped, the pending data is
    discarded, which needs to be fixed.

    but really needs to be added for other libobs objects as well: outputs,
    encoders, services.

    UI: Implement stream delay
    
    When stream delay is active, the "Start/Stop Streaming" button is
    changed in to a menu button, which allows the user to select either the
    option to stop the stream (which causes it to count down), or forcibly
    stop the stream (which immediately stops the stream and cuts off all
    delayed data).
    
    If the user decides they want to start the stream again while in the
    process of counting down, they can safely do so without having to wait
    for it to stop, and it will schedule it to start up again with the same
    delay after the stop.
    
    On the status bar, it will now show whether delay is active, and its
    duration.  If the stream is in the process of stopping/starting, it will
    count down to the stop/start.
    
    If the option to preserve stream cutoff point on unexpected
    disconnections/reconnections is enabled, it will update the current
    delay duration accordingly.

    UI: Add stream delay options to advanced settings
    
    I added stream delay options to advanced settings not just because I
    feel it's an advanced option, but also to reduce clutter in the outputs
    section and its sub-sections, which already have far too many options as
    it is.

    libobs: Add encoded output delay support
    
    This feature allows a user to delay an output (as long as the output
    itself supports it).  Needless to say this intended for live streams,
    where users may want to delay their streams to prevent stream sniping,
    cheating, and other such things.
    
    The design this time was a bit more elaborate, but still simple in
    design:  the user can now schedule stops/starts without having to wait
    for the stream itself to stop before being able to take any action.
    Optionally, they can also forcibly stop stream (and delay) in case
    something happens which they might not want to be streamed.
    
    Additionally, a new option was added to preserve stream cutoff point on
    disconnections/reconnections, so that if you get disconnected while
    streaming, when it reconnects, it will reconnect right at the point
    where it left off.  This will probably be quite useful for a number of
    applications in addition to regular delay, such as setting the delay to
    1 second and then using this feature to minimize, for example, a
    critical stream such as a tournament stream from getting any of its
    stream data cut off.  However, using this feature will of course cause
    the stream data to buffer and increase delay (and memory usage) while
    it's in the process of reconnecting.

    obs-filters: Fix noise-gate calculation errors
    
    For both cases the cur_level calculations were "wrong". For one channel
    case, I assume that was only an oversight, as for two channels case
    cur_level "calculation", getting the level from downmixing to mono will
    result in an attenuated level than expected. One solution is to use the
    highest level of both channels to drive the gate.

    Due to certain design changes for delay, it's better to simply determine
    whether outputs are active via booleans rather than an activeRefs
    variable, which could get decremented more than once if say, the signal
    for stopping the stream gets called more than once for whatever reason
    (which may happen in the case of delay due to the way delay works)

    deps/file-updater: Add file updater util. lib
    
    This allows plugins to update and cache data files from a remote source.
    
    Here are the steps that occur when the API initiates an update check:
    
    1.) It checks to see if the local files are greater than the cached
        files.  If the local version is newer (for whatever reason), it
        replaces the cached version(s) with the local version.
    
    2.) A packages.json file is downloaded from the specified URL.  That
        packages.json file contains a version number and a list of files to
        be updated.
    
    3.) If the downloaded package version is greater than the cached
        version, executes step 4-5 on each file.
    
    4.) Checks the version for the file to update in packages.json, and if
        the version is greater than the cached version, proceeds to step 5,
        otherwise repeat step 4-5 for other files.
    
    5.) Calls the callback given to the update function (if any) with the
        file information (file name, buffer, etc), and if the callback
        returns true, allows the cached file to be updated and replaced,
        otherwise goes back to step 4-6 for the rest of the files.
    
    NOTE: Files are never modified directly.  All file saving/modification
    is performed in a temporary directory, and then files are moved to their
    destination.  This should eliminate any possibility of file corruption
    (or at least dramatically reduce the possibility).

    (API Change) libobs: Add global module config path
    
    API Changed:
    ---------------------------
    From:
    - bool obs_startup(const char *locale, profiler_name_store_t *store);
    
    To:
    - bool obs_startup(const char *locale, const char *module_config_path,
                    profiler_name_store_t *store);
    
    Summary:
    ---------------------------
    This allows plugin modules to store plugin-specific configuration data
    (rather than only allowing objects to store configuration data).  This
    will be useful for things like caching data, for example looking up and
    storing ingests from remote (rather than storing locally), or caching
    font data (so it doesn't have to build a font cache each time), among
    other things.
    
    Also adds a module-specific directory for the UI

    This changes each profile's config file so that the FFmpeg output
    detects whether files are used, and then extracts the file's directory
    and extension and sets them accordingly to make it compatible with the
    new FFmpeg file output handling.

    UI: Allow generated filenames for FFmpeg output
    
    This changes the way the advanced output section's FFmpeg output
    settings work by allowing the user to select whether they want to output
    to a file or output to a URL, and makes it so file names are
    automatically generated like other recording outputs.
    
    If they choose to output to a file, it'll only require an output
    directory similarly to how other recording outputs work.  They can
    select a directory to output to rather than being required to type in a
    full path and filename; the filename is automatically generated.  The
    extension is also automatically retrieved from libff depending on the
    format selected.
    
    Otherwise if they have Output to URL selected, it'll show a simple edit
    box where they can type in the target URL.

    libobs/util: Fix character encoding issue
    
    Manually specifies the UTF-8 character codes used by the file rather
    than relying on the compiler to determine what the codes are manually.
    I was getting compile errors due to the fact that my current code page
    is not at the default code page; so visual c++ tried to use my current
    code page rather than UTF-8 and it would cause an error on the file.

    UI: Fix GCC 4.8 compilation issue
    
    Apparently using QPointer container for the QObject being given to the
    connect function makes it so it can't find the actual function to use.
    I'm guessing this is incomplete functionality or a bug that existed in
    GCC 4.8.  Doesn't happen in 4.9+.

    UI: When setting base res, use closest output res
    
    When settings the base resolution, try to find the closest output
    resolution to the old output resolution, and use that for its value.  If
    the aspect ratio is about the same, then don't modify the value.  If the
    aspect ratio is significantly different, then find the closest
    approximation while keeping with the new aspect ratio.
    
    This particular issue has been an annoyance for quite some time.

    When getting a blank module data file (indicating you want to get the
    path to the module data directory itself), on certain operating systems
    (windows) it will fail if you end the path with '/' or '\'.  So simply
    make sure that if a blank module sub-path is used, don't try to append a
    slash.

    rtmp-services: Add "Show all services" option
    
    I made the rather tough call of not showing all services by default; I
    didn't want to have to do this, but too many services are asking to be
    put in to the program, and any time I add a service in to the list, I
    feel uncomfortable because I feel like I'm potentially advertising them,
    and/or they're using our program to advertise as well.  Some of these
    services are particularly bad at policing illegal/copyrighted content,
    host content that I personally find distasteful or incredibly stupid
    (what the heck is up with these "vaping" streams?), or are just fairly
    terrible websites in general that I just feel uncomfortable with showing
    by default.
    
    However, I do not really want to reject anyone either, I want to let
    their users be able to use our program with relative ease, but more than
    anything I just simple don't want to be seen as "endorsing" some of
    these websites (more than others in particular).  I know that a "show
    all services" checkbox is probably pretty pointless/superfluous thing to
    do, but I feel like it's at the very least a means of saying "hey, I
    don't really endorse these guys," or "use at your own risk," or
    "warning: this website is incredibly terrible."
    
    Honestly, I couldn't really think of any better solution that would
     a.) still list all services without outright censoring them, and
     b.) prevent us from being seen as "endorsing" all services.
    
    (Although maybe this whole thing feels a bit.. passive aggressive.  I
    feel like I'm tipping over someone's garden gnome in the middle of the
    night while they're sleeping.  Still, it's something.)
    
    NOTE: This code is backward compatible; i.e., if you previously had a
    service selected that's not common but don't have the "show all"
    checkbox checked, it'll still show that service for convenience.

    libobs: Prevent registering (potentially) unsupported plugins
    
    The rationale for rejecting these register calls is that these functions
    may be required for the plugin to work properly, which can't be
    guaranteed when libobs doesn't know about them.
    
    This behavior may be revisited once the plugin manager is implemented,
    to e.g. make it configurable (potentially per plugin) to allow loading
    newer plugins in case they are known to work with the older libobs

    (API Change) libobs: Add profile_name_store_t parameter to obs_startup
    
    Due to all the threads in libobs it wouldn't be safe to make that
    parameter reconfigurable after libobs is initialized without adding
    even more synchronization. On the other hand, adding a function to set
    the name store before calling obs_startup would solve the problem of
    passing a name store into libobs, but it can lead to more complicated
    semantics for obs_get_profiler_name_store (e.g., should it always return
    the current name store even if libobs isn't initialized until someone
    calls set_name_store(NULL)? should obs_shutdown call
    set_name_store(NULL)? Passing it as obs_startup parameter avoids
    these (and hopefully other) potential misunderstandings

    UI: Recalculate main preview scale on video reset
    
    Fixes a minor bug introduced by the windowless graphics context merge.
    When setting a new base resolution, it would not recalculate the preview
    size, and the preview would display the wrong size until the main window
    was resized by the user.  This patch makes it so that it calls the
    recalculation function when the base resolution is changed to prevent
    that from happening.

    (API Change) Merge branch 'windowless-context'
    
    API Changed (obs.h):
    -----------------------------------------
    - Removed member variables from struct obs_video_info:
      - window_width
      - window_height
      - window
    
    - Removed functions:
      - obs_add_draw_callback
      - obs_remove_draw_callback
      - obs_resize
      - obs_preview_set_enabled
      - obs_preview_enabled
    
    API Changed (graphics/graphics.h)
    -----------------------------------------
    - Changed third parameter of gs_create from
         const struct gs_init_data *data
      to
         uint32_t adapter
    
    Summary
    -----------------------------------------
    Changing to a windowless context allows the ability to use libobs
    without needing to have it depend on an open window/view, and removes
    superfluous functionality that's already provided by the obs_display
    functions.
    
    Biggest benefits of windowless context:
    - Make it so all window/view related code uses obs_display (which is a
      major refactor/prune)
    - Allows core functions to not have to be dependent upon an existing
      window/view
    - Allow the ability to make a fully CLI front end that doesn't depend on
      a window
    - Allows the ability to a hypothetical CLI from a remote
    
    Because of the API changes, multiple modules are affected by this commit
    to prevent creating broken commits: libobs, libobs-opengl, libobs-d3d11,
    and the UI.
    
    In the libobs back-end, all preview/window API functions that are not
    related to obs_display have been removed, and to draw on a window/view
    you must now always create an obs_display (rather than having "main"
    display functions and then "secondary" display functions that use
    obs_display).
    
    For the technicalities of the graphics back-end, the gs_init function
    now only takes in an adapter parameter instead of window/format/etc
    information.  To draw on a window/view you must now always create a swap
    chain for it (note that obs_display wraps this functionality).
    
    As for the UI, the UI has been refactored so that all dialogs/windows
    that have a preview do not have to manually create OBSDisplay objects;
    the OBSQTDisplay class now automatically handles all the code related to
    displays.  The main window preview now also relies on that same
    functionality/code.

    UI: Move obs startup/shutdown to obs-app.cpp
    
    Now that we aren't dependent upon a window for our context, we can
    safely move the obs context creation/destruction to obs-app.cpp, and use
    the OBSContext helper class to automatically shut down obs.

    libobs-opengl: Use windowless context (windows)
    
    (Non-compiling commit: windowless-context branch)
    
    On windows, you can just create a hidden window as the "main" opengl
    window to get the equivalent of a windowless context.  You might be able
    to do it without a window, but honestly it's more trouble than it's
    worth.

    UI: Change "main preview" to use OBSQTDisplay
    
    (Non-compiling commit: windowless-context branch)
    
    Gets rid of all functions/data related to setting up the main preview to
    be associated with obs_reset_video and instead uses OBSQTDisplay for the
    main window display (thus associating it with an obs_display object).

    UI: Refactor OBSQTDisplay for windowless context
    
    (Non-compiling commit: windowless-context branch)
    
    This makes it so that OBSQTDisplay now uses/controls an obs_display
    object directly (rather than having the owner have to associate an
    OBSDisplay with it).  It was separated before because the main window
    for the basic UI would was using the "main preview" stuff before the
    windowless context and had to be handled differently, so you couldn't
    just associate an obs_display object with OBSQTDisplay, meaning that all
    "secondary" previews such as properties/filters/etc had to handle the
    obs_display alone, which caused a lot of needlessly duplicated code.
    
    Also adds a DisplayCreated signal to allow owners to be able to add
    callbacks and such on creation of the actual obs_display context.

    - window_width
    - window_height
    - window
    
    Summary:
    ---------------------
    Changes the core libobs API to not be dependent upon a main window/view.
    If you wish to draw to a window/view, use an obs_display object to
    handle it.
    
    This allows the use of libobs without requiring a window to be present
    on the system.  This is also prunes code that had to be needlessly
    duplicated to handle the "main" window.

    deps-libff: Adjust start_pts if invalid pts found
    
    If the first guessed pts is less than the start_pts, it could
    lead to a negative PTS being returned.
    
    Change the behavior so that the first frame's pts, if zero, is
    set to the start_pts.  If more than one frame is less than the
    start_pts, the start_pts is determined invalid and set to 0.
    
    Valid start_pts example:
      start_pts = 500
    
      first frame (pts = 0)
        pts = 500 (< start_pts)
        pts -= 500 (offset by start_pts)
    
        ret 0
    
      second frame (pts = 700)
        pts = 700 (no change, > start_pts)
        pts -= 500 (offset by start_pts)
    
        ret 200
    
    Invalid start_pts example:
      start_pts = 500
    
      first frame (pts = 0)
        pts = 500 (< start_pts)
        pts -= 500 (offset by start_pts)
    
        ret 0
      second frame (pts = 300)
        pts = 300 (< start_pts, start_pts set to 0)
        pts -= 0 (start_pts is now 0)

    libobs: Add function to get the windows version
    
    Microsoft basically deprecated GetVersion/GetVersionEx, so now you have
    to query the file version of kernel32.dll in order to get the actual
    windows version.  Because of the steps involved in getting the windows
    version are fairly complicated, this is an exported libobs helper
    function that can be used to get the windows version if needed.
    (Microsoft does have its own set of helper functions for this but the
    API feels a bit..  awkward, and you can't actually get the real windows
    version with them)

    additionally used to draw to a view.  However, we're already using the
    Objective-C function flushBuffer, which apparently calls glFlush
    internally anyway to draw to views.  That means that we're superfluously
    calling glFlush most of the time if there's an active swap chain.  So
    instead, only call glFlush when there are no active swap chains on OSX.

    libobs: Use one copy for RGBA output when possible
    
    A minor optimization: in copy_rgbx_frame (used when libobs is set to
    output RGBA frames instead of YUV frames), if the line sizes for the
    source and destination match, just use a single memcpy call for all of
    the data instead of multiple memcpy calls.

    When globbing for modules, the intent was to ignore the . and ..

    mistakenly doing a string compare on the 'path' variable which contains
    the full path, rather than the 'file' variable which just contains the
    found file itself, so the string compare always failed.

    In case the encoder has to use a different sample rate (due to the
    sample rate being unsupported), we need an API function for the encoder
    to get the sample rate that the encoder is actually running at.

    libobs: Fix audio filters killing video on source
    
    When an audio filter is applied to a video source that also has
    accompanying audio, it would cause the video from the source to stop
    rendering.
    
    The original code this was from was to prevent audio-only sources from
    rendering video, but I neglected to make sure that this would not apply
    to filters, and thus when an audio filter is on a source with video, the
    code would kill the video.

    UI: Properly ensure save on exit
    
    I broke the save that happens on exit by making all project saves put on
    the message queue.  The save on exit would put the save on to the
    message queue, then by the time the save occurred obs would already be
    shut down.
    
    This just calls the save function directly rather than deferring it to
    the message queue.

    UI: Fix potential deadlocks when saving
    
    SaveProject calls obs functions that locks certain mutexes, and because
    I made it so that SaveProject was being called inside of certain signal
    handlers (which could already be locked in other mutexes), it could
    cause a mutual deadlock with other threads.
    
    This fix puts the main project saving code in to SaveProjectDeferred,
    then pushes it on to the Qt message queue to safely save outside of
    those locks.  It's a function that's perfectly safe to put on the
    message queue because it will automatically be disabled in certain
    circumstances where it would be unsafe to call, such as on shutdown.
    
    This code will also make it so that the project will not needlessly be
    saved more than once if the SaveProjectDeferred call was pushed multiple
    times on to the queue.

    ipc-util: Fix access rights issue with IPC pipe
    
    This was the reason why game capture could not hook when the hook was
    run at administrator level and the game/target was below administrator
    level: it was because the plugin created a pipe, and the hook tried to
    connect to that pipe, but because the pipe was created as administrator
    with default access rights, the pipe did not allow write access for
    anything below administrator level, therefor the hook could not connect
    to the plugin, and the hook would always fail as a result.
    
    This fixes the issue by creating the pipe with full access rights to
    everyone instead of default access rights.

    I've come to realize that it's probably not wise to deviate from the

    problems have been due to the fact that the direct hook method (via
    CreateRemoteThread) was removed, so I put it back in, made it default,
    and added an option to use anti-cheat compatibility just like in the
    original version.

    deps-libff: Fix starting timestamp bug
    
    Certain input streams (such as remote streams that are already active)
    can start up mid-stream with a very high initial timestamp values.
    Because of this, it would cause the libff timer to delay for that
    initial timestamp, which often would cause it to not render at all
    because it was stuck waiting.
    
    To fix the problem, we should ignore the timestamp difference of the
    first frame when it's above a certain threshold.

    deps-libff: Offset start of stream by start pts
    
    Now that we're using the timestamps from the stream for playback,
    certain types of streams and certain file formats will not start from a
    pts of 0.  This causes the start of the playback to be delayed.  This
    code simply ensures that there's no delay on startup.  This is basically
    the same code as used in FFmpeg itself for handling this situation.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix potential integer overflows
    
    This particularly affected audio encoding, audio encoding previously
    would count samples and use it to create an encoding timestamp, but
    because I was using a standard integer (which is 32bit by default on
    x86), it would max out at about 0x7FFFFFFF samples, which is about 12
    hours of samples at 48000 sample rate.  After that, it would start going
    into negative territory (overflowing).  By changing it to int64_t, it
    will make it so that audio at 48000 samples per second would only be
    able to overflow after about..  6.09 million years.  In other words,
    this should fix the issue for good.

    services that are dedicated to specific types of content (stated above).

    win-capture: Add 64bit bounce to func_hook
    
    When hooking 64bit functions, sometimes the offset between the function
    being hooked and the hook itself can be large enough to where it
    requires a 64bit offset to be used.  However, because a 64bit jump
    requires overwriting so many code instructions in the function, it can
    sometimes overwrite code in to an adjacent function, thereby causing a
    crash.
    
    The 64bit hook bounce (created by R1CH) is designed to prevent using
    very long jumps in the target by creating executable memory within a
    32bit offset of that target, and then writing it with the 64bit long
    jump instruction instead.  Then in the target function, it will jump to
    that memory instead, thus forcing the actual hooked function to use a
    32bit hook instead of a 64bit hook, and using at most 5 bytes for the
    actual hook, preventing any likelihood of it overwriting an adjacent
    function.

    UI: Use default scaled res. of 1280x720 or equiv.
    
    Originally this value defaulted to 1.5 downscaling, but on very high
    resolution displays this would cause the default to be above 1280x720,
    which is not ideal for streaming/recording due to the CPU usage
    requirements.
    
    Instead, it will now find the closest resolution with a pixel count
    equivalent to or closest below 1280x720, and use that instead.

    UI: Do not delete via takeItem in ClearListItems
    
    Apparently some raw lingering pointers to the item widgets may be
    present inside of the QListView if you delete the item widgets directly,
    and the only way to ensure those pointers are properly cleared is to
    call ->clear() on the list widget instead of deleting each item
    individually.
    
    We were deleting each item individually because we thought that
    ->deleteLater might be also be called on other data within, but after
    some testing, that turned out to not be the case, so it's safe to call
    ->clear() on the list widget.
    
    As a note, deleting item widgets directly is dangerous due to the
    potential for lingering raw internal pointers, and our case is unique
    where we can get away with it; do not delete list item widgets directly
    unless you intend on calling ->clear() or ->takeItem on the specific
    item you do it to after.
    
    Again, the reason why we are deleting list widget items manually is due
    to the fact that Qt will always use ->deleteLater() on them if they are
    not deleted manually, which puts their deletion on the queue.  Only
    problem is they cannot be removed from the queue once added, so
    lingering references to sources will persist until the queue processes
    them, which causes major problems if we need those objects deleted right
    away.

    decklink: Use audio/video timestamps from SDK
    
    System timestamps were being used instead of timestamps from the
    audio/video input.  This would cause potential desync as well as
    incremental buffering when using devices with the blackmagic video
    source.  Using the timestamps direct from the SDK itself fixes those
    issues, and causes audio/video to play back properly and in sync.

    UI: Add drag&drop reordering for the sources list

commit 95857b4443d09156db5ac8c7a84a7f0f6bc41364
Author: Palana <palana@stunned.de>
Date:   Sat Jun 27 04:06:34 2015 +0200

    UI: Enable drag&drop reordering for scenes
    
    The empty implementation for the QDataStream operators is necessary to fix
    a Qt assertion: "QVariant::save: unable to save type
    'std::vector<std::shared_ptr<OBSSignal> >' (type id: 1036)."
    
    It doesn't seem like a full implementation of the stream operators would be
    useful since the signal registration is very specific to the interaction
    between the scenes and sources list, i.e. in case the scenes list ever accepts
    scenes from sources (not 'obs_source's) other than itself (non InternalMove
    drag&drop?) it would have to register those scenes with the libobs core which
    should trigger the normal signal registration

    UI: Implement scene reordering
    
    This simply saves/loads the actual list widget item order.
    
    The reason why this is done is because internally, libobs doesn't have a
    list of scenes, it only has a list of sources.  The list of scenes is
    actually something artificially implemented by the basic window user
    interface.

    In addition to the flv file format, this allows the ability to save to
    container formats such as mp4, ts, mkv, and any other containers that
    support the current codecs being used.
    
    It pipes the encoded data to the ffmpeg-mux process, which then safely
    muxes the file from the encoded data.  If the main program unexpectedly
    terminates, the ffmpeg-mux piped program will safely close the file and
    write trailer data, preventing file corruption.

    obs-ffmpeg: Use timestamps from video/audio frames
    
    Instead of using system timestamps for playback, use the timestamps
    directly from the video/audio data to ensure all the data is synced up
    using the obs_source back-end.
    
    I think the original misconception when this was written was that OBS
    would not handle timestamp resets/loops, which isn't the case; it will
    actually handle all timestamp resets and abnormalities.  It's always
    best to use the obs_source back-end for all playback and syncing.

    win-dshow: Add audio output mode options
    
    This allows the ability to output the audio of the device as desktop
    audio (via the WaveOut or DirectSound audio renderers) instead of
    capturing the audio only.
    
    In the future, we'll implement audio monitoring which will make this
    feature obsolete, but for the time being I decided to add this option as
    a temporary measure to allow users to play the audio from their devices
    via the DirectShow output.

    UI: Change default simple audio bitrate to 160
    
    The audio bitrate required is insignificant relative to the video
    bitrate, and due to the fact that it's possible that a lower-quality
    encoder may be in use (such as FFmpeg's AAC encoder), setting the
    default to 160 is really more ideal to reducee any potential quality
    loss.

    libobs: Increase async jitter compensation
    
    Due to the fact that async timestamps themselves can be susceptible to
    minor jitter from certain types of inputs, increase the allowable jitter
    compensation value to ensure that the rendered frame timing from async
    video sources is always as close as possible to the compositor.
    
    When the framerate of the source is the same as the framerate as the
    compositor, this (combined with the fact that clamped video timing now
    being used with async video frames) helps ensure that buffered async
    video sources will sync up their rendering to the compositor as
    accurately as possible despite jitter from the source's timestamps.
    
    If there is no jitter in the source's timestamps then it'll always sync
    up perfectly with the compositor, thanks to clamped video timing.

    libobs: Use clamped video time for async timing
    
    When playing back buffered async frames, this reduces the probability
    that new frames will be missed/skipped due to jitter in the system
    timestamps.
    
    If a buffered async source is playing at the same framerate as the
    compositor and there is no jitter in the async source's timestamps, then
    the async source will play back perfectly in sync with the compositor
    thanks to this change, ensuring that there's no skipped or missed frames
    in video playback.

    libobs: Save clamped video time
    
    The "clamped" video time is the system time per video frame that is
    closest to the current system time, but always divisible by the frame
    interval.  For example, if the last frame system timestamp was 1600 and
    the new frame is 2500, but the frame interval is 800, then the
    "clamped" video time is 2400.
    
    This clamped value is useful to get the relative system time without any
    jitter.

    libobs: Reset frame cache if it gets too big
    
    When buffering is enabled for an async video source, sometimes minor
    drift in timestamps or unexpected delays to frames can cause frames to
    slowly buffer more and more in memory, in some cases eventually causing
    the system to run out of memory.
    
    The circumstances in which this can happen seems to depend on both the
    computer and the devices in use.  So far, the only known circumstances
    in which this happens are with heavily buffered devices, such as
    hauppauge, where decoding can sometimes take too long and cause
    continual frame playback delay, and thus continual buffering until
    memory runs out.  I've never been able to replicate it on any of my
    machines however, even after hours of testing.
    
    This patch is a precautionary measure that puts a hard limit on the
    number of async frames that can be currently queued to prevent any case
    where memory might continually build for whatever reason.  If it goes
    over the limit, it clears the cache to reset the buffering.
    
    I had a user with this problem test this patch with success and positive
    feedback, and the intervals between buffering resets were long to where
    it wasn't even noticeable while streaming/recording.
    
    Ideally when decoding frames (such as from those devices), frame
    dropping should be used to ensure playback doesn't incur extra delay,
    although this sort of hard limit on the frame cache should still be
    implemented regardless just as a safety precaution.  For DirectShow
    encoded devices I should just switch to faruton's libff for decoding and
    enable the frame dropping options.  It would probably explain why no
    one's ever reported it for the media source, and pretty much only from
    DirectShow device usage.

    UI: Replace Qt5Network classes with libcurl
    
    The Qt5Network classes seem to only support OpenSSL, and because OpenSSL
    isn't available on windows, we would have to distribute it with the
    program to get SSL access working.  The problem with that is that
    OpenSSL is not GPL-compatible, so we cannot distribute OpenSSL with the
    program, which means we have to find a better (and preferably superior)
    library for accessing remote files that can use the windows SSPI for our
    SSL needs, which comes with the operating system.
    
    Fortunately, libcurl is probably the best library out there, and can be
    compiled with SSPI instead of OpenSSL, so we're just going to switch to
    libcurl instead.  Originally I thought it didn't support SSPI, otherwise
    I would have implemented it sooner.
    
    As a side note, this will make it so we'll able to get files from the
    internet via plugins, which will be quite useful.

    UI: Add SelectScene hotkey
    
    UI supplied per scene hotkey to allow switching between scenes; this
    has to be done in the UI since it's up to the application to define
    what exactly "changing/selecting a scene" means (changing the output
    of channel 0 may not be enough for other applications)

    UI: Add OBSHotkey{Edit,Label,Widget}
    
    OBSHotkeyEdit is similar to QKeySequenceEdit, except less terribad on OSX, while
    OBSHotkeyWidget provides a container that automagically encapsulates multiple
    bindings per hotkey
    
    OBSHotkeyLabel in combination with OBSHotkeyWidget provides mechanisms for
    dealing with hotkey pairs (see upcoming usage in window-basic-settings.cpp)

    UI: Show remaining reconnect timeout duration
    
    When a reconnect is occurring, the user doesn't really know that the
    program is waiting to reconnect to the server or not, nor does the user
    know how many seconds are remaining until that next attempt.  This will
    show the reconnect timeout countdown as it's occurring.

    libobs: Use exponential backoff for reconnecting
    
    Implements exponential backoff for consecutive reconnects, which is
    useful to prevent too many connections from trying to reconnect back to
    a service at once over a short period of time in the case of potential
    service downtime.  Exponential backoff causes each subsequent reconnect
    attempt to double its timeout duration.

    libobs: Add timeout_sec param to reconnect signal
    
    This optionally allows the front-end to know what the current timeout
    value in seconds is set to for the reconnection without having to call

    (yet ?) available by default. According to the manpage getline was a
    GNU extension but was standardized in POSIX.1-2008.

    Always use -fPIC when not on WIN32 or APPLE and not just with gcc.
    This allows for building obs with clang on linux and FreeBSD
    without explicitly specifying -fPIC as compiler flag to cmake.

    linux-v4l2: Fix build when missing ENUM_DV_TIMINGS
    
    Add compatibility with older versions of the api by not failing to
    build when the VIDIOC_ENUM_DV_TIMINGS is missing. In older versions
    of the api there was a different system to get dv-timing presets, which
    was replaced by the current enumeration system with Linux 3.4.
    This will allow for the plugin to be built against older versions of the
    api by disabling the enumeration support, thus reducing the
    functionality for some devices.

    the device would not support this.
    The new device_caps field was introduced with Linux 3.3.

    UI: Add warning for non-NV12 color formats
    
    Non-NV12 video formats are primarily intended for recording.  For
    streaming, if the libobs color format is not set to NV12, it's likely
    that the video frames will have to be converted to NV12, which will use
    extra CPU usage.  Due to that fact, it's important to warn the user of
    that potential extra increased CPU usage that may be required when
    streaming.

    (API Change) Remove encoder callback boilerplate
    
    API Changed (in struct obs_encoder_info):
    ----------------------------------------
    bool (*get_audio_info)(void *data, struct audio_convert_info *info);
    bool (*get_video_info)(void *data, struct video_scale_info *info);
    
    To:
    ----------------------------------------
    void (*get_audio_info)(void *data, struct audio_convert_info *info);
    void (*get_video_info)(void *data, struct video_scale_info *info);
    
    The encoder video/audio information callbacks no longer need to manually
    query the libobs video/audio information, that information is now passed
    via the parameter, which the callbacks can modify.
    
    The refactor that reduces boilerplate in the encoder video/audio
    information callbacks also removes the need for their return values, so
    change the return types to void.

    libobs: Refactor video/audio encoder conversion
    
    I realized that the get_video_info and get_audio_info encoder callbacks
    always have to manually query the libobs audio/video information.
    
    This fixes that problem by passing the libobs video/audio information in
    the structures passed to those callbacks so they don't have to query it
    each time, reducing needless boilerplate code for encoders.

    UI: Enable video output format advanced option
    
    This allows using NV12, I420, or RGB output video formats.  This option
    will set what obs itself outputs frames as.
    
    It's important to note that this is only ideal for specific FFmpeg
    encoders that support the desired video format; for example, if you use
    RGB and use the huffyuv encoder, huffyuv will now properly output in RGB
    instead of YUV NV12/I420.
    
    I420 is useful for eliminating the NV12->I420 conversion for the
    AVerMedia encoders, as AVerMedia encoders only support I420 input.
    
    A second even more important note about RGB is that if the encoder does
    not support the format you are using, it will be converted on the CPU to
    a format that the encoder supports as it's encoded; so for example
    setting the obs output format to RGB and then using x264 will be futile
    and end up using needless amounts of extra CPU than if you just had obs
    set to NV12, which is the most common and ideal format for x264.
    
    In the future, native output of other YUV formats might be implemented
    (such as YUV 4:2:2).

    libobs: Init source mutexes before calling create
    
    Fixes a crash that could happen if any of the mutexes are used in the
    create callback, or before the obs_source_init function is called.
    
    I'm not sure how this function order slipped because it seems fairly
    obvious that these mutexes should be created before the create callback.
    
    Had this crash happen to me when creating a WASAPI output source, the
    create callback of the WASAPI source creates a thread which outputs
    audio, and that thread managed to call obs_source_output_audio before
    the obs_source_init function was called, which in turn caused it to try
    to use a null mutex.

    win-dshow: Add option to allow vertical flip
    
    I'm putting this option in due to the fact that there are legitimate
    cases where a device may flip the output unexpectedly (such as the
    Datapath VisionDVI-DL running in RGB video format), and that a user may
    want to be able to view the source in a projector or source properties
    without the image being inverted.
    
    My original line of thinking was that they can just use a transform to
    flip the image, but I felt this problem impacts rendering everywhere,
    such as in the projector and in the source properties, so having it as
    an option in the source itself feels like the best way to ensure that a
    user can get it to render everywhere properly.

    UI: Add SliderAbsoluteSetStyle class
    
    When this class is used in conjunction with a QSlider control, allows
    direct setting of the slider handle position when clicking in an area
    other than the slider handle.  The default QSlider handle behavior is to
    step towards clicked position.

    libobs: Increment new frame ref when first copying
    
    When caching a new frame, keep a reference to the frame while copying to
    ensure that the frame is not potentially destroyed for whatever reason
    while that data is being copied.

    libobs: Fix async texture data race
    
    The obs_source::async_reset_texture variable can cause a data race
    between threads to occur because it could be set to true in one thread
    then changed back to false in another thread.  This could cause the
    async texture to not update its size when it's supposed to, which can
    cause a crash or corruption when copying data from a frame of a
    differing size.
    
    The solution to this is to:
    
    - Delete the async_reset_texture variable, and make the
      set_async_texture_size function change the texture size if the
      async_width, async_height, or async_format variables differ from the
      frame's width/height/format.  Those variables are then only ever set
      in the libobs graphics thread.
    
    - Make the cache_video function use separate variables from other
      functions to detect a change in size (due to the fact that the texture
      size should only be resized in the libobs graphics thread).  These
      variables are async_cache_width, async_cache_height, and
      async_cache_format, which are only be set in the thread that calls
      obs_source_output_video.
    
    How to replicate the data race:
    
    - On OSX, use window capture on a textedit window, then continually
      resize the textedit window.

    libobs: Fix full range min/max output
    
    The minimum and maximum color range values were not being set by the
    video_format_get_parameters function when full range was in use; I
    assume it's because the expected min/max values of full range is
    {0.0, 0.0, 0.0} and {1.0, 1.0, 1.0}, so I'm just making it so that it
    sets those values if using full range.
    
    Way to replicate the issue (windows):
    1.) Create a win-dshow device capture source
    2.) Select a device and set it to a YUV color format to enable YUV color
    conversion
    3.) Select "Full Range" in the color range property.
    4.) Restart OBS, the device will then start up, but will display green
    due to the fact that the min/max range values were never set, and are
    left at their default value of 0.

    libobs: Fix bug with filter bypassing
    
    Due to a bad 'if' expression, when a filter that is not last in the
    chain is disabled or being bypassed, it ends up still calling the
    filter's video processing function unintentionally.
    
    This fix makes sure that it only calls the appropriate render functions
    if the next filter target is the source, otherwise it will just call
    obs_source_video_render to process the next filter in the chain.
    
    How to replicate the bug:
    1. Create two crop filters on the same source
    2. Give each crop filter a different distinct value
    3. Disable both crop filters
    4. The image would still be cropped

    The normal scaling methods cannot sample enough pixels to create an

    to ensure a more accurate low resolution image.

    mac-capture: Fix display capture cursor bug
    
    The kCGDisplayStreamShowCursor option used with the dictionary does not
    work if you assign @true or @false to it.  After some testing, it needs
    to point to the id cast of either kCFBooleanTrue or kCFBooleanFalse in
    order for it to work properly.
    
    If it doesn't use either of those values, the display stream seems to
    use its internal default, which on 10.8 and 10.9 is visible, and 10.10+
    is invisible, which would explain why people on 10.10 couldn't get the
    cursor to capture.

    obs-ffmpeg: Fix spurious bad channel layout
    
    Some formats (like WMV) would send out audio packets that
    had channels set but did not specify a channel layout.
    Solution is to no longer rely on channel layout to get the
    channels and just get the channel count directly off the
    FFmpeg audio frame.

    libobs: Use default blend state with scenes
    
    Instead of manually setting the blend state to the desired values, use
    gs_reset_blend_state to ensure we have the default blend state (which
    for color is a typical srcalpha/invsrcalpha alpha blending operation,
    then the alpha channels are added together).
    
    This fixes an issue where filtered scenes would look strange due to the
    fact that alpha was not being blended properly.

    Add gs_blend_function_separate
    
    This allows the ability to separate the blend states of color and alpha.
    
    The default blend state has also changed so that alpha is always added
    together to ensure that the destination image always gets an alpha value
    that is actually usable after the operation (for render targets).
    
    Old default state:
      color source: GS_BLEND_SRCALPHA, color dest: GS_BLEND_INVSRCALPHA
      alpha source: GS_BLEND_SRCALPHA, alpha dest: GS_BLEND_INVSRCALPHA
    
    New default state:
      color source: GS_BLEND_SRCALPHA, color dest: GS_BLEND_INVSRCALPHA
      alpha source: GS_BLEND_ONE,      alpha dest: GS_BLEND_ONE

    libobs: Clear current async frame if cache freed
    
    If the cache is freed the current async frame will of course become
    invalid, so make sure it's set to null if the cache is freed.

    libobs: Deallocate lingering unused cache frames
    
    This fixes an issue where cache frames would not free at all after
    having been allocated with no upper limit on the cached frame size.  If
    cached frames go unused for a specific period of time, they are
    deallocated and removed from the cache.
    
    This is preferable to having an upper cache limit due to the potential
    for async delay filtering.

    libobs: Fix memory leak (Enforce cache limit)
    
    Under certain circumstances the cache could be prone to growing too
    large unintentionally.  Setting a hard maximum limit should prevent
    memory from growing if we suddenly get a lot of frames.

    libobs: Swap async source frames in tick
    
    Async frames are only swapping when rendering, or when not visible.
    This is a flawed design due to the fact that there are certain
    circumstances where the source is neither visible nor currently
    rendering.
    
    This is what caused a memory leak when scene items were marked as
    invisible, because if a source has an async child source and decides not
    to render that source for whatever reason, the child source would not
    process the async frames at all, and the cache would just grow.
    
    To fix this, simply moving the async frame cycle to tick fixes the issue
    due to the fact that tick is always called regardless of circumstance.

    I did not end up using the Qt::ItemIsUserCheckable flag with the list
    items for a few reasons:
    
    - We could not style the checkbox indicator without qss screwing up
      other parts of the list widget style on certain operating systems
    
    - We could not get the icon to properly invert on active selection like
      the text does on mac/linux, which made it look strange
    
    - Clicking the checkbox too fast would cause it to signal a double-click
      on the icon, opening the properties for a source in the source list

    and similarly for effect filters move above/below other effect filters.

    libobs: Mark audio filters as async
    
    Async filters and effect filters are really two different classes of
    filters, so it's important that audio filters be marked as async.

    libobs: Filter async video before rendering
    
    Filtering the video before it's output to the texture means that it
    happens after all the processing on the timestamps and such of the video
    data.  This way, the video filter does not have to worry about what's
    currently buffered, and it won't affect timing.

    libobs: Fix potential bug destroying filters
    
    When OBS is shutting down, if for some reason the filter is destroyed
    before the parent source is destroyed, it would try to remove itself
    from the source, but it would decrement the reference and try to destroy
    itself again while already in the process of destroying itself.
    
    So, the solution was simply to make sure that if it's removing itself
    from the source that it doesn't decrement its own reference.

    (API Change) Fix filter rendering design flaw
    
    obs_source_process_filter tried to do everything in a single function,
    but the problem is that effect parameters would not properly be
    accounted for due to the way it internally draws, therefore it was
    necessary to split the functions in to two, you first call
    obs_source_process_filter_begin, then you set your effect parameters,
    then you finally call obs_source_process_filter_end.  This ensures that
    when the filter is drawn, that the effect parameters are set.

    libobs: Fix rendering at end of the filter chain
    
    When the filter chain finally reaches the source and the last filter in
    the chain is set to not render directly (meaning it has to render to
    texture), it would not render the source with any effect due to the fact
    that it expects a filter to be present.

    There are a few more conditions which need to be checked to ensure

    can't really use the bypass optimization in those situations.

    libobs: Add API to get base source dimensions
    
    These functions are primarily for use with filters, filters need to be
    able to get the width/height of a target source without it necessarily
    getting the post-filtered dimensions.

    libobs: Do not clear frame cache if 0,0 dimension
    
    Previously I had it set so that it would set the async_width and
    async_height variables to 0,0 if a null frame occurs, but the problem
    with this is that it was inadvertently cause the frame cache to clear
    when it starts receiving textures again because it detects it as a size
    change.
    
    So instead of changing async_width and async_height to 0 when a null
    frame occurs, change it so that if the source is set to an inactive
    state, make obs_source_get_width/_get_height return 0 for their
    dimensions instead.

    libobs: Use reference counting with source frames
    
    When a frame is processed by a filter, it comes directly from the
    source's video frame cache.  However, if a filter is using or processing
    those frames for whatever reason, there would be no guarantee that the
    frames would persist during processing, and frames could eventually be
    deallocated unexpected, for example when the resolution or format
    changes.
    
    So the solution is to implement simple reference counting for the frames
    so that the frames will exist until they have been released by any
    source or filter that's using them.

    libobs: Add int/float slider properties
    
    This optionally specifies that the int/float value should be displayed
    with a slider rather than and up/down control.  UIs are not necessarily
    required to implement it, it's meant to be more of a hint.

    Make capture sources w/o alpha use opaque effect
    
    This fixes an issue primarily with filter rendering: when capturing
    windows and displays, their alpha channel is almost always 0, causing
    the image to be completely invisible unintentionally.  The original fix
    for this for many sources was just to turn off the blending, which would
    be fine if you're not rendering any filters, but filters will render to
    render targets first, and that lack of alpha will end up carrying over
    in to the final image.
    
    This doesn't apply to any mac captures because mac actually seems to set
    the alpha channel to 1.

    libobs: Add obs_get_opaque_effect function

    alpha channel overridden to 1.0.

    libobs: Fix default negative int/float shader vals
    
    If negative was specified it would not parse the negative sign and thus
    would not interpret that number as negative, and would cause
    shader/effect parsing to simply fail on the file.

    Switching between shaders often can cause a performance hit, so cache
    effects so that they persist until the graphics subsystem is destroyed.

    libobs-opengl: Fix bug switching render targets
    
    If a render target was switched from one to another and then back
    consecutively, the texture would not get reattached at the last point
    due to the fact that the cur_render_target variable of the FBO storage
    structure would already be set to that texture, and then it would never
    get reattached because it thought it was already using that render
    target.
    
    So to fix this, any time a render target legitimately changes from one
    to another, it sets the cur_render_target and cur_zstencil_buffer
    variables of the FBO structure to null.

    libobs-opengl: Do not fail if shader param unused
    
    I encountered a scenario where effects might reference shader parameters
    that may not potentially exist, this isn't particularly a bad thing that

    libobs-opengl: Fix render targets being flipped
    
    When render targets are used, they output to the render target inverted
    due to the way that opengl works.  This fixes that issue by inverting
    the projection matrix so that it renders the image upside down and
    inverting the front face from counterclockwise to clockwise.

    UI: Fix typo in dark theme causing wrong borders
    
    This fixes an issue where the borders for certain types of windows would
    not match the intended border style/color.  It was supposed to be 1
    through 6 for frameShape, but I ended up putting 5 twice.

    libobs: Fix bug (source resampler not resetting)
    
    If the audio data had the same format/samplerate as the obs audio
    subsystem, it would fail to simply destroy the resampler and set it to
    NULL, and then any audio data going through would use the resampler that
    was being used before that, causing audio to become garbage.
    
    This bug only started appearing when I recently changed the libobs
    internal audio subsystem format to non-interleaved floating point, which
    is a common format, and thus caused this bug to actually occur more
    often.

    libobs: Don't ignore starting audio if async
    
    I when a source has both async audio/video capability, it would ignore
    audio until the video has started.  There's really no need to do this,
    when the video starts it'll just fix up the timing automatically.
    
    This should fix the case where things like the media source would not be
    able to play audio-only files.

    (API Change) Always use planar float audio output
    
    Core API functions changed:
    -----------------------------
    EXPORT bool obs_reset_audio(struct audio_output_info *aoi);
    EXPORT bool obs_get_audio_info(struct audio_output_info *aoi);
    
    To:
    -----------------------------
    EXPORT bool obs_reset_audio(const struct obs_audio_info *oai);
    EXPORT bool obs_get_audio_info(struct obs_audio_info *oai);
    
    Core structure added:
    -----------------------------
    struct obs_audio_info {
            uint32_t            samples_per_sec;
            enum speaker_layout speakers;
            uint64_t            buffer_ms;
    };
    
    Non-interleaved (planar) floating point output is standard with audio
    filtering, so to prevent audio filters from having to worry about
    different audio format implementations and for the sake consistency
    between user interfaces, make it so that audio is always set to
    non-interleaved floating point output.

    UI: Give "advanced" section icon a white border
    
    Instead of trying to replace this icon, I feel like just giving it a
    white border is sufficient to make it usable in both light and dark
    themes.
    
    The only other option is to add icon changing code for themes for this
    particular type of widget, and I felt it was best to not go down that
    route due to the complexity involved.

    (API Change) Fix "apply service settings" functions
    
    API changed from:
    ------------------------
    EXPORT void obs_service_apply_encoder_settings(obs_service_t *service,
                    obs_encoder_t *video_encoder,
                    obs_encoder_t *audio_encoder);
    
    void obs_service_info::apply_encoder_settings(void *data
                            obs_encoder_t *video_encoder,
                            obs_encoder_t *audio_encoder);
    
    To:
    ------------------------
    EXPORT void obs_service_apply_encoder_settings(obs_service_t *service,
                    obs_data_t *video_encoder_settings,
                    obs_data_t *audio_encoder_settings);
    
    void obs_service_info::apply_encoder_settings(void *data
                            obs_data_t *video_encoder_settings,
                            obs_data_t *audio_encoder_settings);
    
    These changes make it so that instead of an encoder potentially being
    updated more than once with different settings, that these functions
    will be called for the specific settings being used, and the settings
    will be updated according to what's required by the service.
    
    This fixes that design flaw and ensures that there's no case where
    obs_encoder_update is called where the settings might not have
    service-specific settings applied.

    the filter mutex, these functions can no longer be used with a
    const-qualified obs_source_t pointer.

    linux-v4l2: Add buffering option
    
    Add a source property to enable buffering of frames, which is enabled by
    default. This replaces the old "Use system timing" option by setting the
    unbuffered source flag instead of using different timestamps.
    While similar in intentions to the old option, this method should reduce
    latency even more.

    The update_properties signal is created before the view itself is

    libobs: Use video thread for show/active callbacks
    
    For the show/hide and activate/deactivate callbacks, schedule these
    callbacks to only be called from within the video thread rather than in
    a separate thread.  This ensures that any potential graphics activity
    that occurs within them is kept in the same thread.

    UI: Indicate source is being shown in properties
    
    When viewing the properties of a source, there's no way to specify that
    a source is actually being shown or not to the core.  This uses the new
    obs_source_inc_showing and obs_source_dec_showing to tell the source
    that it's being shown/hidden in this part of the program without
    necessarily having to use a new render view just to render it.

    libobs: Add functions to show/hide sources
    
    obs_source_inc_showing and obs_source_dec_showing are used to indicate
    that a source is showing or no longer being shown in a particular area
    of the program outside from the main render view.
    
    One could use an obs_view, but I felt like it was unnecessary because
    using an obs_view just to display a single source feels somewhat
    superfluous.

    The main view does not need to worry about hiding/deactivation of

    there's no need to worry about deactivating/hiding sources.

    mac-avcapture: Default to unbuffered video capture
    
    By default, video plays back based upon the timestamp for each frame,
    and buffers the frames as needed to ensure that they play back at the
    expected timing.
    
    However, this can add some minor additional delay to the video, and may
    not be ideal for certain devices such as webcams and generally any
    device that has minimal latency.  However, because those are the only
    type of devices that typically have drivers, there's no real need to
    have it on by default.
    
    This adds an option to use buffering, and leaves it off by default.

    linux-v4l2: Improve logging of pixel format
    
    Use the macro from the mac capture plugin to convert the fourcc integer
    value to a string. This makes the debug statement for the pixel format
    slightly more readable for the casual developer.

    linux-v4l2: Remove "Leave Unchanged" option
    
    Remove the "Leave Unchanged" option for the input and video format
    select.
    
    This option was primarily added for cases in which the
    resolution and framerate are set by another program or the capture
    device itself and the values are not directly supported by the plugin.
    One major usecase here would be capture devices for tv signals which
    might be set to a spcific resolution and refresh rate, and might fail
    to initialize in case any other combination of those settings is forced.
    
    In case of the input this option did not make much sense, as the first
    input is probably the best default option in most cases.
    
    For the video format this default is even bad in some cases. If an
    format emulated by libv4l2 is selected for example, this will usually
    configure the device to use mjpeg with libv4l2 converting it to some
    format obs can use. When obs or the source is then restarted and the
    "Leave Unchanged" is enabled the plugin will fail, because it will only
    notice that the device is set to mjpeg, without any knowledge about the
    possibility of letting libv4l2 handle the conversion.
    
    Using the first available and supported format is not nescessarily the
    best choice, but still preferable to some random format that will
    cause the plugin to not capture at all. Forcing a choice here will
    hopefully also make the plugin behaviour more predicatable for the user.

    libobs: Handle obs_scene_add failure
    
    Previously a NULL item would cause a crash when reading transform info.
    The crash can be reproduced by e.g. editing scenes.json so that two
    scenes contain each other. Example scenes.json:
    
    {
        "current_scene": "Scene",
        "sources": [
            {

    Generate proper DL_OPENGL value for linux
    
    Since we rely on the dynamic linker to find the library for us via
    dlopen(), we need to have DL_OPENGL be .so.N, not the full library
    filename, as ldconfig doesn't cache the full filename
    
    Use of TARGET_SONAME_FILE requires the library to be marked as SHARED,
    not MODULE

    win-capture: Fix hook bug that could cause crashes
    
    I had this issue where IDXGISwapChain::ResizeBuffers would fail in the
    hooks, causing games to crash when they resized their backbuffers
    because ResizeBuffers would return an 'invalid call' HRESULT value.  In
    the ResizeBuffers documentation it says that it will only happen if a
    backbuffer currently has any outstanding references, but there's no way
    this would happen unless ResizeBuffers internally calls Present or vise
    versa.
    
    After ResizeBuffers has been called, the very first call to Present will
    somehow seemingly invalidate and/or destroy the current backbuffer.
    It's very strange, but that seems to be what's going on, at least for
    the game I was testing.  So if you are performing a post-overlay
    capture, then you must ignore the capture on the very first call to
    Present.
    
    It's Microsoft's code so you can't really know what's going on, you just
    have to work around these strange issues seemingly in the dark.

    win-dshow: Fix stack overflow bug
    
    Martell changed this function without realizing that this was calling a
    function below it, not recursively calling itself.  The reason why he
    got the warning was because there was no forward declaration of the
    function that was being called; I think he's used to C where only one
    function definition can exist with the same name.  In this case, it was
    another function with the same name but with different parameters,
    something that's permitted in C++.  I wish I had realized this sooner.
    
    This fixes the crashes people have been having with devices.

    mac-syphon: Name plugin "Game Capture (Syphon)"
    
    People were getting a bit confused over what the "Syphon" source was,
    and often wouldn't use it because they didn't know what it was for.

    libobs: Fix multi. video encoder sync issues
    
    When using multiple video encoders together with a single audio encoder,
    the audio wouldn't be in sync.
    
    The reason why this occurred is because the dts_usec variable of the
    encoder packet (which is based on system time) would always be reset to
    a value based upon the dts (which is not guaranteed to be based on
    system time) in the apply_interleaved_packet_offset function.  This
    would then in turn cause it to miscalculate the starting audio/video
    offsets, which are required to calculate sync.
    
    So instead of calling that function unnecessarily, separate the check
    for whether audio/video has been received in to a new function, and only
    start applying the interleaved offsets after audio and video have
    actually started up and the starting offsets have been calculated.

    UI: Add "enforce streaming service settings"
    
    Add a checkbox named "Enforce streaming service encoder settings"
    checkbox to advanced output.  Disabling this checkbox allows the user to
    optionally disable the enforcement of streaming service encoder
    settings.  I had a user complain that they didn't want to always have
    the service's preferred encoder settings forced on them.

    cases where the developer may not wish to apply the service-specific
    settings, or may wish to override them for whatever reason.

    libobs-d3d11: Fix vertical alignment
    
    Someone's going to yell at me about this, but fix vertical alignment for
    certain member variables in the main header.
    
    For future reference, if you must use vertical alignment, always give it
    plenty of space for the type names to grow in case you need to
    add/change variables in the future; don't just align to the 'longest'
    value, give it an extra 8-16 spaces for potential future variables.
    This is done to prevent having to make commits like this in the future
    that sort of pollute the history.

    libobs-d3d11: Fill out switch enum values
    
    When using an enumeration value with a switch, it needs to be filled out
    with all possible values to prevent compiler warnings.  This warning is
    used to prevent the developer from unintentionally forgetting to add new
    enum values to any switches the enum is used on later on.  Sadly, only
    good compilers actually have this warning (mingw).

    microsoft's fabulously dumb little INVALID_SOCKET define, so we have to
    make librtmp use that instead.

    obs-d3d11: Use cinttypes header (mingw)
    
    There appears to be a bug with mingw where including the regular C
    inttypes.h won't work; instead you have to use the 'cinttypes' C++
    version.

    win-capture: deal with a 32bit handle cast errors
    
    The HWND type is a void pointer, but HWND values are global and always
    32bit despite, so casting to 32bit can cause cast warnings on actual
    good compilers like gcc via mingw.  This change correctly handles the
    casting to 32bits without producing unwanted warnings or errors on
    mingw.

    For the 'rescale' settings in advanced outputs, the scales must all be
    divisible by two.

    UI: Base encoder rescales on output resolution
    
    The 'rescale' values in advanced output section are supposed to be based
    upon the output resolution of the program.  Meaning they should not be
    used for scaling up, because the resolution downloaded from the graphics
    processor is the output resolution set in video settings; thus any
    resolution you set for the 'rescale' values is scaled from that.

    UI: Add advanced output settings
    
    Adds an 'advanced' mode to the output settings to allow more powerful
    and complex streaming and recording options:
    
    - Optionally use a different encoder for recording than for streaming to
      allow the recording to use a different encoder or encoder settings if
      desired (though at the cost if increased CPU usage depending on the
      encoders being used)
    
    - Use encoders other than x264
    
    - Rescale the recording or streaming encoders in case the user wishes to
      stream and record at different resolutions
    
    - Select the specific mixer to use for recording and for streaming,
      allowing the stream and recording to use separate mixers (to for
      example allow a user to stream the game/mic audio but only record the
      game audio)
    
    - Use FFmpeg output for the recording button instead of only recording
      h264/aac to FLV, allowing the user to output to various different
      types of file formats or remote URLs, as well as allowing the user to
      select and use different encoders and encoder settings that are
      available in the FFmpeg library
    
    - Optionally allow the use of multiple audio tracks in a single output
      if the file formats or stream services support it

    obs-x264: Set bitrate/bufsize max to 10 mil.
    
    The max bitrate for the property was 100000 before, which felt a bit
    low.  Might as well have a super high upper limit of 10 million.

    obs-x264: Add more properties
    
    Add CBR, CRF to properties so that it can be changed by the user.  If
    CBR is on, CRF will be disabled.  Also added a 'Use Custom Buffer Size'
    option to make it so that the buffer size will automatically be set to
    the bitrate if its value is false.  This is primarily a convenience
    feature for users.

    Certain RTMP services will support multi audio tracks via RTMP.  This
    updates librtmp with custom code that enables multiple streams per
    connection to be used; each subsequent stream typically containing extra
    audio tracks.  The audio encoder names are used to indicate the names of
    tracks, and the name of the tracks are used for the stream keys for
    those subsequent tracks.

    obs-ffmpeg: Make FFmpeg a usable output
    
    This makes FFmpeg usable as an output, and removes or changes most of
    the code that was originally intended for testing purposes.
    
    Changes the settings for the FFmpeg output to the following:
    * url:             Sets the output URL or file path
    * video_bitrate:   Sets the video bitrate
    * audio_bitrate:   Sets the audio bitrate
    * video_encoder:   Sets the video encoder (by name, blank for default)
    * audio_encoder:   Sets the audio encoder (by name, blank for default)
    * video_settings:  Sets custom video encoder FFmpeg settings
    * audio_settings:  Sets custom audio encoder FFmpeg settings
    * scale_width:     Image scale width (0 if none)
    * scale_height:    Image scale height (0 if none)
    
    The reason why scale_width and scale_height are provided is because it
    may internally convert formats, and it may be a bit more optimal to use
    that scaler instead of the pre-output scaler just in case it already has
    to convert formats internally anyway (though you can do it either way
    you wish).
    
    Video format handling has also changed; it will now attempt to use the
    closest format to the current format if available for a given video
    codec.

    I feel like it should really just be called 'Tracks' here for lack of a
    better term.

    (API Change) Add support for multiple audio mixers
    
    API changed:
    --------------------------
    
    void obs_output_set_audio_encoder(
                    obs_output_t *output,
                    obs_encoder_t *encoder);
    
    obs_encoder_t *obs_output_get_audio_encoder(

                    const char *id,
                    const char *name,
                    obs_data_t *settings);
    
    Changed to:
    --------------------------
    
    /* 'idx' specifies the track index of the output */
    void obs_output_set_audio_encoder(
                    obs_output_t *output,
                    obs_encoder_t *encoder,

    /* 'idx' specifies the track index of the output */
    obs_encoder_t *obs_output_get_audio_encoder(
                    const obs_output_t *output,
                    size_t idx);
    
    /* 'mixer_idx' specifies the mixer index to capture audio from */
    obs_encoder_t *obs_audio_encoder_create(
                    const char *id,
                    const char *name,
                    obs_data_t *settings,
                    size_t mixer_idx);
    
    Overview
    --------------------------
    This feature allows multiple audio mixers to be used at a time.  This
    capability was able to be added with surprisingly very little extra
    overhead.  Audio will not be mixed unless it's assigned to a specific
    mixer, and mixers will not mix unless they have an active mix
    connection.
    
    Mostly this will be useful for being able to separate out specific audio
    for recording versus streaming, but will also be useful for certain
    streaming services that support multiple audio streams via RTMP.
    
    I didn't want to use a variable amount of mixers due to the desire to
    reduce heap allocations, so currently I set the limit to 4 simultaneous
    mixers; this number can be increased later if needed, but honestly I
    feel like it's just the right number to use.
    
    Sources:
    
    Sources can now specify which audio mixers their audio is mixed to; this
    can be a single mixer or multiple mixers at a time.  The
    obs_source_set_audio_mixers function sets the audio mixer which an audio
    source applies to.  For example, 0xF would mean that the source applies
    to all four mixers.
    
    Audio Encoders:
    
    Audio encoders now must specify which specific audio mixer they use when
    they encode audio data.
    
    Outputs:
    
    Outputs that use encoders can now support multiple audio tracks at once
    if they have the OBS_OUTPUT_MULTI_TRACK capability flag set.  This is
    mostly only useful for certain types of RTMP transmissions, though may
    be useful for file formats that support multiple audio tracks as well
    later on.

    UI: Fix bug when canceling first source properties
    
    When you launch the source properties for the first time, the settings
    for the source are empty and default values are used.  With the new
    OK/Cancel buttons that were recently merged, it first saves the old
    settings, then if the user cancels applies those old settings.
    
    However, because the first settings are always empty, obs_source_update
    will try to apply the old settings (which are empty) to the modified
    settings, but it can't reset to those settings because it's technically
    not applying any settings at all.
    
    In other words, when you create the source and modified the properties
    for your first time, pressing cancel would not reset anything at all.
    
    This fixes that issue by clearing the current settings with
    obs_data_clear before updating the source with the old settings, which
    ensures that any settings that were empty are reset to an empty status.

    libobs: Fix obs_data_apply
    
    obs_data_apply is used to apply the changes of a source object in to a
    destination object.  Problem with this however is that if sub-objects
    are in use, it currently just copies the pointer of the sub-object,
    meaning that the source and destination will both share the same
    sub-object via reference.  If anything modifies that sub-object data,
    it'll modify it for both objects, which was not intended.
    
    Instead of copying the object pointer, create a new copy and then
    recursively repeat the process to ensure the data is always completely
    separate.

    I don't like this function returning an allocation by default.
    Similarly to what was done with the wide character conversion functions,
    this function now operates on an array argument, and if you really want
    to just get a pointer for convenience, you use the *_ptr version of the
    function that clearly indicates that it's returning an allocation.

    Use QDialogButtonBox to add "Okay" and "Cancel" buttons to the

    I.E. the settings are still applied to the source as the user changes
    them. If the user clicks "Okay", the dialog simply exits. If the user
    clicks "Cancel", the original settings are reapplied to the source then
    the dialog exits. If the window is closed by any other means (I.E. by
    the main obs window closing) then the properties dialog prompts the user
    if they changed anything and asks if they wish to save their settings.
    
    In order to implement this last feature, a method of checking for open
    dialogs and sending each a quit message is added to the closeEvent()
    method for OBSBasic.

    libobs: Add function to enumerate video adapters
    
    The gs_enum_adapters function is an optional implementation to allow
    enumeration of available graphics adapters that can be used with the
    program.  The ID associated with the adapter can be an index or a hash
    depending on the implementation.

    libobs: Fix calculation copying aligned textures
    
    Direct3D textures are usually aligned to a specific pitch, so their
    internal width is often not equal to the expected output width; this
    means that if we want to use it on our texture output, that we must
    de-align the texture while copying the texture data.
    
    However, I unintentionally messed up the calculation at some point with
    RGBA textures, so the variable size I was supposed to be using was
    supposed to be multiplied by 4 (for RGBA), while I was still expecting
    single channel data.  So, if the texture width was something like 1332,
    the source (directx) texture line size would be somewhere at or above
    5328 (because it's RGBA), then destination is at 1332 (YUV luma plane),
    and it would unintentionally treat 3996 (or 5328 - 1332) bytes as the
    unused alignment data.  So this fixes that miscalculation.

    UI: Fix minor stylesheet issues
    
    This does a few small things
    -Moves buttons down 20px to the same height as the list boxes
    -Adds a QFrame around scrollArea for mixer list.
    
    Q: Why was this done?
    A: When you go to style the mixer list in regards to adding a border,
    shadow, or glow, it needs to be done on the QFrame. If you do it on the
    scrollArea itself, the scrollbars will overlap the bottom of the border,
    causing the border to look cut-off. Additionally, the other two sources
    and scenes list widgets already had frames, so they did not have this
    problem.

    Previously a DirectShow hardware encoder would get 'stuck' and couldn't
    be recreated due to a strange issue with the graph filter not properly
    shutting down the encoder.  This would make it so that the user could
    only use the encoder once, and then it wouldn't work anymore any time it
    was initialized again.  dshowcapture version 0.4.2 ensures that the
    encoder can restart properly by manually shutting down the filter graph.

    The activate button is just silly for configuration in retrospect.  It's

    Instead of using an 'Activate' button for game capture every time you
    want to capture a window, just make the 'window' list have a default 'no
    window' value (empty), and then have it always active when an actual
    window is selected.  The way syphon handles this on mac is actually
    where I took the idea from (as suggested by Palana).

    This subclass filters out double clicks for any mouse button other than
    the left mouse button to fix this issue.

    win-capture: Wait before auto-fullscreen hooking
    
    If using the auto-fullscreen feature to hook in to a fullscreen, I found
    that if you don't wait a few seconds before initializing the hook that
    you can catch the process when it's just starting up and loading
    important libraries (especially things such as steam/uplay/etc), which
    can cause a little bit of interference with the process and on rare
    occasions cause it to crash.
    
    To help prevent the likelihood of that happening, this just makes it so
    that the hook waits at least 3 seconds before even attempting to inject
    the hook when using auto-fullscreen mode.  After some extensive testing
    I haven't had any issues since.

    win-capture: Retry hooks on most failures
    
    The design to not retry the hooks on most general error is just bad.
    There are plenty of legitimate cases where it should retry the hook.
    
    This changes it so that if a general failure occurs or if it isn't
    capturing when the inject helper exits, it retries and increases the
    length of time between retries.

    win-capture: Add 'retry_interval' variable
    
    Adds a variable 'retry_interval' to game capture that allows the
    interval at which game capture checks to update to longer intervals if
    the hook initialization has some sort of failure.
    
    The reason why I want to do this is because I don't really like it when
    the hook updates too often in failure, it just leads to log file spam
    that I feel can be reduced, and it frequent updates feel a bit invasive.
    I just generally feel more comfortable reducing the interval at which
    the hook retries after failure.

    win-capture: Change inject-hook intervals
    
    This makes a minor adjustment to the interval at which the inject helper
    tries to post the inject message to the target process.  Only 2 seconds
    before, now up to 4 seconds, with the PostThreadMessage called every
    half second for the duration.
    
    The reason I did this is because I noticed that on rare occasions that
    it wouldn't hook due to the low interval; usually just because the
    target process is busy and isn't able to process its message queue, and
    therefor the hook wouldn't go through due to the fact that
    SetWindowsHookEx won't inject until the set event has occurred.  The
    inject helper program would just close before the thread message had
    finally been processed, which would cancel the SetWindowsHookEx hooking.

    UI: Set a maximum height to properties scroll area
    
    When a source has a lot of properties, the scroll area containing them
    would try to expand to fit them all, often leaving the preview area
    super squished.  So this just sets a maximum height for the properties
    scroll area.

    libobs: Add frame caching for async video sources
    
    The temporary unoptimized code we were using before just completely
    allocated a new copy of each frame every single time a new async frame
    was output by the source plugin.  This just creates a cache of frames as
    needed for the current format/width/height to minimize the allocation
    and deallocation.  If new frames come in that are of a different
    format/width/height, it'll just clear the cache.  This is a fairly
    important optimization.

    This is a bit of an optimization to reduce load a little bit if any of
    the video capture sources are not currently being displayed on the
    screen.  They will simply not capture or update their texture data if
    they are not currently being shown anywhere.
    
    The mac and window game capture sources don't really apply due to the
    fact that their textures aren't updated on the source's end (they update
    inside of the hooks).

    UI: Add vertical scroll area subclass
    
    The regular scroll area can expand horizontally, but the problem with
    this is that sometimes there are controls within it that expand way too
    big.
    
    For example, the properties window for window capture can have a list of
    windows where the titles of the windows are really really long, and it
    causes the properties to extend way too far to the right, making the
    window look really unusual.
    
    Another example are the volume controls in the main window that can
    expand way to the right if the name of a source is really long, causing
    the volume control to stretch way too far to the right, making the
    volume controls difficult to use when that happens.
    
    So this just makes it so it sets the maximum width of a scroll area's
    internal widget to the actual width of the scroll area, preventing it
    from going off the side of the scroll area.

    Webcams, internal devices, and other such things on windows do not
    really need to be buffered, and buffering incurs a tiny bit of delay, so
    turning off buffering is actually a little better for non-encoded
    devices.

    libobs: Redesign/optimize frame encoding handling
    
    Previously, the design for the interaction between the encoder thread
    and the graphics thread was that the encoder thread would signal to the
    graphics thread when to start drawing each frame.  The original idea
    behind this was to prevent mutually cascading stalls of encoding or
    graphics rendering (i.e., if rendering took too long, then encoding
    would have to catch up, then rendering would have to catch up again, and
    so on, cascading upon each other).  The ultimate goal was to prevent
    encoding from impacting graphics and vise versa.
    
    However, eventually it was realized that there were some fundamental
    flaws with this design.
    
    1. Stray frame duplication.  You could not guarantee that a frame would
       render on time, so sometimes frames would unintentionally be lost if
       there was any sort of minor hiccup or if the thread took too long to
       be scheduled I'm guessing.
    
    2. Frame timing in the rendering thread was less accurate.  The only
       place where frame timing was accurate was in the encoder thread, and
       the graphics thread was at the whim of thread scheduling.  On higher
       end computers it was typically fine, but it was just generally not
       guaranteed that a frame would be rendered when it was supposed to be
       rendered.
    
    So the solution (originally proposed by r1ch and paibox) is to instead
    keep the encoding and graphics threads separate as usual, but instead of
    the encoder thread controlling the graphics thread, the graphics thread
    now controls the encoder thread.  The encoder thread keeps a limited
    cache of frames, then the graphics thread copies frames in to the cache
    and increments a semaphore to schedule the encoder thread to encode that
    data.
    
    In the cache, each frame has an encode counter.  If the frame cache is
    full (e.g., the encoder taking too long to return frames), it will not
    cache a new frame, but instead will just increment the counter on the
    last frame in the cache to schedule that frame to encode again, ensuring
    that frames are on time and reducing CPU usage by lowering video
    complexity.  If the graphics thread takes too long to render a frame,
    then it will add that frame with the count value set to the total amount
    of frames that were missed (actual legitimately duplicated frames).
    
    Because the cache gives many frames of breathing room for the encoder to
    encode frames, this design helps improve results especially when using
    encoding presets that have higher complexity and CPU usage, minimizing
    the risk of needlessly skipped or duplicated frames.
    
    I also managed to sneak in what should be a bit of an optimization to
    reduce copying of frame data, though how much of an optimization it
    ultimately ends up being is debatable.
    
    So to sum it up, this commit increases accuracy of frame timing,
    completely removes stray frame duplication, gives better results for
    higher complexity encoding presets, and potentially optimizes the frame
    pipeline a tiny bit.

    libobs: Fix bug with frame output handling
    
    The boolean variables which stored whether frames have been

    libobs: Fix potential crash on output stop
    
    In certain circumstances where the output was stopping, and where data
    took a long enough time to send (such as when using an encoding preset
    that causes high CPU usage), the output would sometimes still send data
    even after it was stopped, typically causing the output to crash.

    libobs: Fix force mono channel count
    
    I unintentionally made it use obs_source::sample_info instead of using
    the actual target channel count, which is designated by the OBS output
    sampler info.  obs_source::sample_info is actually used to indicate the
    currently set sampler information for incoming samples.  So if a source
    is outputting 5.1 channel 48khz audio, and OBS is running at stereo
    44.1khz, then the obs_source::sample_info value would be set to
    5.1/48khz, not the other way around.  It indicates what the source
    itself is running at, not what OBS is running at.
    
    I suppose the variable needs a better name because even I used it
    incorrectly despite actually having been the one who wrote it.

    libobs: Refactor source volume transition design
    
    This changes the way source volume handles transitioning between being
    active and inactive states.
    
    The previous way that transitioning handled volume was that it set the
    presentation volume of the source and all of its sub-sources to 0.0 if
    the source was inactive, and 1.0 if active.  Transition sources would
    then also set the presentation volume for sub-sources to whatever their
    transitioning volume was.  However, the problem with this is that the
    design didn't take in to account if the source or its sub-sources were
    active anywhere else, so because of that it would break if that ever
    happened, and I didn't realize that when I was designing it.
    
    So instead, this completely overhauls the design of handling
    transitioning volume.  Each frame, it'll go through all sources and
    check whether they're active or inactive and set the base volume
    accordingly.  If transitions are currently active, it will actually walk
    the active source tree and check whether the source is in a
    transitioning state somewhere.
    
     - If the source is a sub-source of a transition, and it's not active
       outside of the transition, then the transition will control the
       volume of the source.
    
     - If the source is a sub-source of a transition, but it's also active
       outside of the transition, it'll defer to whichever is louder.
    
    This also adds a new callback to the obs_source_info structure for
    transition sources, get_transition_volume, which is called to get the
    transitioning volume of a sub-source.

    libobs: Keep transition reference counter
    
    The reason to keep a reference counter for transitions is due to an
    optimization I'm planning on when calculating transition volumes.  I'm
    planning on walking the source tree to be able to calculate the current
    base volume of a source, but *only* if there are transitions active,
    because the only time that the volume can be anything other than 1.0
    or 0.0 is when there are active transitions, which may change the base
    volume of a source.

    libobs: Do not set presentation volume on children
    
    When the presentation volume is set for a source, it's set for all of
    its children and their children.  The original intention for doing this
    was to be able to use it for transitioning, but honestly it's just bad
    design, and I feel there are better ways to handle transitioning volume.

    Changed the design from using obs_source::enum_refs to just simply

    so that it now returns a boolean, and if the function fails, it means
    that the child cannot be added due to that potential recursion.

    libobs: Fix a few warnings
    
    Two integers are needlessly converted to floating points for what should
    be an integer operation.  One of those floats is then used for another
    integer operation later, where the original integer value should have
    been used.  So essentially there was an int -> float -> int conversion
    going on, which could lead to potential loss of data due to floating
    point precision.
    
    There were also some general 64bit -> 32bit conversion warnings.

    On i3wm, windows aren't unmapped when switching away from a window's

    switching back will not trigger a MapNotify, the capture fails to
    restart unless you resize or move the window (ConfigureNotify). An
    Expose event is fired by the wm, however, so catching this correctly
    restarts the capture.

    win-dshow: Add C985/C353 hardware h264 encoders
    
    This adds support for the AverMedia C985 encoder (which is available on
    C985 capture cards) as well as the C353 hardware encoder (which is
    currently available on the X99S Gaming 9 motherboards).
    
    These encoders have some limitations, such as limited resolutions
    (1280x720 and 1024x768), a max GOP size of 30, and the encoder format
    only supports YV12, which requires conversion if the current output
    format isn't the same.  The C985 and C353 encoders seem to be pretty
    much identical, although it seems like the C353 has a bit more efficient
    encoding.
    
    I don't believe these are really suitable for streaming, as they do not
    really have the encoding efficiency needed to stream at lower bitrates,
    and seem to only support variable bitrate.  However, for recording these
    encoders are quite nice to have available, and work quite well.

    things to the module as a whole.

    win-dshow: Allow use of YV12 video format
    
    Previously, due to a bug in libdshowcapture, the NV12 format was
    actually being used for YV12 erroneously, and no actual support for YV12
    existed.  This fixes the bug with NV12 and adds support for YV12.

    obs-outputs: Wait for packet before header output
    
    Waiting for the first packet to arrive before sending the headers helps
    prevent issues with certain types of encoders that may not get their
    header/SEI until the first packet has been received.

    (API Change) libobs: Add bicubic/lanczos scaling
    
    This adds bicubic and lanczos scaling capability to libobs to improve
    scaling quality and sharpness when the output resolution has to be
    scaled relative to the base resolution.  Bilinear is also available,
    although bilinear has rather poor quality and causes scaling to appear
    blurry.
    
    If the output resolution is close to the base resolution, then bilinear
    is used instead as an optimization, as there's no need to use these
    shaders if scaling is not in use.
    
    The Bicubic and Lanczos effects are also exposed via exported function
    to allow the ability to use those shaders in plugin modules if desired.
    
    The API change adds a variable 'scale_type' to the obs_video_info
    structure that allows the user interface to choose what type of scaling
    filter should be used.

    looking washed out due to a potentially incorrect color range.

    win-capture: Add game capture
    
    This adds the windows version of game capture.
    
    New features:
    
    - An option to hook any fullscreen application automatically (that
      doesn't have borders) so that no specific window configuration is
      required.  Definitely a sorely needed feature
    
    - An option to force memory capture for the sake of compatibility with
      things such as SLI, multi-adapter setups (usually laptops), as well as
      the ability to be used with the OpenGL renderer
    
    - An optimization option to force scaling on the GPU before texture
      transfer, reducing the transfer bandwidth (which is especially
      important for compatibility capture)
    
    - An optimization option to limit framerate to the current OBS framerate
      to improve capture performance (mostly useful for compatibility
      capture)
    
    - An option to capture third-party overlays (such as steam)
    
    - Logging improvements, game capture log will now be sent via pipe
      instead of written to a separate file, making diagnosing problems a
      little bit easier

    win-capture: Add get-graphics-offsets helper
    
    Before, game capture would find addresses to important graphics
    functions by creating a graphics context for the desired API inside of
    the hook, and then find the function addresses that way.
    
    The big problem with that is that the context could often cause the
    hooked application to crash, especially if another hook was active.
    
    This bypasses that entire need by a simple console application that
    creates the contexts, finds the hook address offsets and then returns
    them via console output.

    These functions allow the safe hooking of windows functions,
    specifically windows API functions that may or may not have built-in
    machine code to help aid in reverse chain hooks.
    
    If a new hook is applied to an existing forward hook, that hook will be
    preserved to prevent that new hook's data from being removed
    unintentionally.
    
    Hopefully with all these precautions this will reduce the likelihood of
    crashes and abnormal hook behavior, while allowing existing hooks to be
    preserved, and allowing new hooks to be applied.

    libobs-opengl: Don't display unimportant messages
    
    The glDebugMessageCallback function will set a callback that will relay
    all messages coming from the driver (on supported drivers at least).
    For nvidia, sometimes there are a lot of irrelevant messages, which is
    nice depending on the type of application you're writing.
    
    I actually at first thought these messages were important, but it turns
    out that they're almost always irrelevant and not actually warnings.
    Most of the messages at a certain type/severity are mostly for debugging
    purposes or minor hints about how to maximize performance, so
    unfortunately there ends up being a lot of pointless spam in the debug
    output.
    
    The particular performance messages are related to optimizations you can
    get via multithreading, and are optimizations you would expect for games
    more than for this type of application.  They don't really apply for our
    use cases most of the time.
    
    High severity messages however are not omitted regardless of message
    type.
    
    These messages can be enabled again by simply defining the
    SHOW_ALL_GL_MESSAGES macro.

    libobs: Fix conversion shader D3D display bug
    
    Just for a quick background: D3D's fmod intrinsic is very imprecise.
    Naturally floating points aren't precise at all, and when the numbers
    you're dealing with become very large, it can often be off by 0.1 or
    more.
    
    However, apparently 0.1 isn't enough of an offset to ensure a proper
    value when using the fmod intrinsic and then flooring the value.  0.2
    seems to fix the issue and make the image display properly.

    Add ipc-util static library for IPC functions
    
    Originally I made the "win_pipe" stuff for named pipes on windows but it
    was argued that it should be available to all modules and
    programs/libraries that the modules might communicate with.
    
    It cannot really be put in to libobs due to the fact that there would
    hypothetically be things unrelated to libobs that might want to use it,
    so I felt the best option was just to create a simple static library
    specific for interprocess communication.
    
    Non-windows versions of these functions are still yet to be implemented.

    win-capture: Always set class/title/exe to null
    
    When getting the class/title/exe of a particular window handle in the
    build_window_strings function, always set the class/title/exe pointers
    to null to prevent any potential references to invalid values if any of
    them do not happen to be set for whatever reason.

    libobs: Add flush to video pipeline
    
    On certain GPUs, if you don't flush and the window is minimized it can
    endlessly accumulate memory due to what I'm assuming are driver design
    flaws (though I can't know for sure).  The flush seems to prevent this
    from happening, at least from my tests.  It would be nice if this
    weren't necessary.

    obs/libobs: Use new volume meter api
    
    This replaces the old code for the audio meter that was using
    calculations in two different places with the new audio meter api.
    The source signal will now emit simple levels instead of dB values,
    in order to avoid dB conversion and calculation in the source.
    The GUI on the other hand now expects simple position values from
    the volume meter api with no knowledge about dB calculus either.
    That way all code that handles those conversions is in one place,
    with the option to easily add new mappings that can be used
    everywhere.

    The volume meter object will use the same mapping functions as the

    obs: Use new fader from libobs for volume control
    
    This replaces the code for volume control with a newer version that
    uses the new fader implementation in order to control the fader/slider
    position and source volume.
    The volume label will now indicate the gain in dB instead of percent,
    mainly because it looks cool and is easy to do.
    Due to libobs saving the multiplier option for the source instead of
    the slider/fader positon, existing volume levels will (mostly) stay
    the same with only the slider beeing at a different position.
    This is of course within the resolution of the slider (100 steps).

    libobs: Add audio control functions
    
    This adds a new library of audio control functions mainly for the use in
    GUIS. For now it includes an implementation of a software fader that can
    be attached to sources in order to easily control the volume.
    The fader can translate between fader-position, volume in dB and
    multiplier with a configurable mapping function.
    Currently only a cubic mapping (mul = fader_pos ^ 3) is included, but
    different mappings can easily be added.
    
    Due to libobs saving/restoring the source volume from the multiplier,
    the volume levels for existing source will stay the same, and live
    changing of the mapping will work without changing the source volume.

    graphics: Add gs_effect_loop helper function
    
    This function greatly simplifies the use of effects by making it so you
    can call this function in a simple loop.  This reduces boilerplate and
    makes drawing with effects much easier.  The gs_effect_loop function
    will now automatically handle all the functions required to do drawing.
    
    ---------------------
    Before:
    
    gs_technique_t *technique = gs_effect_get_technique("technique");
    
    size_t passes = gs_technique_begin(technique);
    for (size_t pass = 0; pass < passes; pass++) {
            gs_technique_begin_pass(technique, pass);
    
            [draw]
    
            gs_technique_end_pass(technique);
    }
    gs_technique_end(technique);
    
    ---------------------
    After:
    
    while (gs_effect_loop(effect, "technique")) {
            [draw]
    }

    Add helper functions for drawing sources
    
    If you look at the previous commits, you'll see I had added
    obs_source_draw before.  For custom drawn sources in particular, each
    time obs_source_draw was called, it would restart the effect and its
    passes for each draw call, which was not optimal.  It should really use
    the effect functions for that.  I'll have to add a function to simplify
    effect usage.
    
    I also realized that including the color matrix parameters in
    obs_source_draw made the function kind of messy to use; instead,
    separating the color matrix stuff out to
    obs_source_draw_set_color_matrix feels a lot more clean.
    
    On top of that, having the ability to set the position would be nice to
    have as well, rather than having to mess with the matrix stuff each
    time, so I also added that for the sake of convenience.
    
    obs_source_draw will draw a texture sprite, optionally of a specific
    size and/or at a specific position, as well as optionally inverted.  The
    texture used will be set to the 'image' parameter of whatever effect is
    currently active.
    
    obs_source_draw_set_color_matrix will set the color matrix value if the
    drawing requires color matrices.  It will set the 'color_matrix',
    'color_range_min', and 'color_range_max' parameters of whatever effect
    is currently active.
    
    Overall, these feel much more clean to use than the previous iteration.

    linux-capture: Add X border option to xcomposite
    
    XComposite, which is currently our only capture method for windows,
    doesn't handle X border width. This works in a lot of cases but anytime
    there's a border, a bug occurs where the lower right is clipped.  This
    patch has two goals:
    
    1) To position and size the capture texture correctly in accordance to
    the border.
    
    2) Adds a configuration option to allow people to toggle it (which in
    most cases will simply do nothing) with a default of not including it.

    Fix asset crash interleaving with active encoders
    
    Apparently the audio isn't guaranteed to start up past the first video
    frame, so it would trigger that assert (which I'm glad I put in).  I
    didn't originally have this happen when I was testing because my audio
    buffering was not at the default value and didn't trigger it to occur.
    A blunder on my part, and once again a fine example of how you should
    never make assumptions about possible code path.

    Add optional source flags
    
    This moves the 'flags' variable from the obs_source_frame structure to
    the obs_source structure, and allows user flags to be set for a specific
    source.  Having it set on the obs_source_frame structure didn't make
    much sense.
    
    OBS_SOURCE_UNBUFFERED makes it so that the source does not buffer its
    async video output in order to try to play it on time.  In other words,
    frames are played as soon as possible after being received.
    
    Useful when you want a source to play back as quickly as possible
    (webcams, certain types of capture devices)

    The obs_source_frame should not need to take flags to do this.  This
    shouldn't be a setting associated with the frame, but rather a setting
    associated with the source itself.  This was the wrong approach to
    solving this particular problem.

    be a better way of handling this, such as using system timestamps.
    Also, the obs_source_frame::flags member needs to be removed and
    replaced with something a bit more ideal.

    Fix a major sync bug
    
    This bug would happen if audio packets started being received before
    video packets.  It would erroneously cause audio packets to be
    completely thrown away, and in certain cases would cause audio and video
    to start way out of sync.
    
    My original intention was "don't accept audio until video has started",
    but instead mistakenly had the effect of "don't start audio until a
    video packet has been received".  This was originally was intended as a
    way to handle outputs hooking in to active encoders and compensating
    their existing timestamp information.
    
    However, this made me realize that there was a major flaw in the design
    for handling this, so I basically rewrote the entire thing.
    
    Now, it does the following steps when inserting packets:
    
    - Insert packets in to the interleaved packet array
    
    - When both audio/video packets are received, prune packets up until the
      point in which both audio/video start at the same time
    
    - Resort the interleaved packet array
    
    I have tested this code extensively and it appears to be working well,
    regardless of whether or not the encoders were already active with
    another output.

    media-io: Fix repeating video timestamps
    
    In video-io.c, video frames could skip, but what would happen is the
    frame's timestamp would repeat for the next frame, giving the next frame
    a non-monotonic timestamp, and then jump.  This could mess up syncing
    slightly when the frame is finally given to an outputs.

    Add timestamp circlebuf for video input/output
    
    At the start of each render loop, it would get the timestamp, and then
    it would then assign that timestamp to whatever frame was downloaded.
    However, the frame that was downloaded was usually occurred a number of
    frames ago, so it would assign the wrong timestamp value to that frame.
    
    This fixes that issue by storing the timestamps in a circular buffer.

    Detect audio time values within OS time thresh.
    
    If audio timestamps are within the operating system timing threshold,
    always use those values directly as a timestamp, and do not apply the
    regular jump checks and timing adjustments that normally occur.
    
    This potentially fixes an issue with plugins that use OS timestamps
    directly as timestamp values for their audio samples, and bypasses the
    timing conversions to system time for the audio line and uses it
    directly as the timestamp value.  It prevents those calculations from
    potentially affecting the audio timestamp value when OS timestamps are
    used.
    
    For example, if the first set of audio samples from the audio source
    came in delayed, while the subsequent samples were not delayed, those
    first samples could have potentially inadvertently triggered the timing
    adjustments, which would affect all subsequent audio samples.

    Use MAX_TS_VAR for timestamp jump detection
    
    This combines the 'direct' timestamp variance threshold with the maximum
    timestamp jump threshold (or rather just removes the max timestamp jump
    threshold and uses the timestamp variance threshold for both timestamp
    jumps and detecting timestamps).
    
    The reason why this was done was because a timestamp jump could occur at
    a higher threshold than the threshold used for detecting OS timestamps
    within a certain threshold.  If timestamps got between those two
    thresholds it kind of became a weird situation where timestamps could be
    sort of 'stuck' back or forward in time more than intended.  Better to
    be consistent and use the same threshold for both values.

    This allows the user to select whether to use unbuffered video or not.
    Unbuffered video cause the video frames to play back as soon as they're
    received, rather than be buffered and attempt to play them back
    according to the timestamp value of each frame.

    Add flag to obs_source_frame for unbuffered video
    
    Add 'flags' member variable to obs_source_frame structure.
    
    The OBS_VIDEO_UNBUFFERED flags causes the video to play back as soon as
    it's received (in the next frame playback), causing it to disregard the
    timestamp value for the sake of video playback (however, note that the
    video timestamp is still used for audio synchronization if audio is
    present on the source as well).
    
    This is partly a convenience feature, and partly a necessity for certain
    plugins (such as the linux v4l plugin) where timestamp information for
    the video frames can sometimes be unreliable.

    70 milliseconds is a bit too high for the default audio timestamp
    smoothing threshold.  The full range of error thus becomes 140
    milliseconds, which is a bit more than necessary to worry about.  For
    the time being, I feel it may be worth it to try 50 milliseconds.

    function to decode the window title/class/exe strings from a window

    This adds code to set up the udev monitoring library and use the events
    to detect connects/disconnects of devices.
    When the currently used device is disconnected the plugin will stop
    recording and clean up, so that the device node is freed up.
    On reconnection of the device the plugin will use the event to
    automatically start the capture again.

    Add option to use Sparkle for updates
    
    OBS Sparkle feeds have two extensions to vanilla Sparkle feeds:
    - There can be two kinds of items per feed: (zipped) .app and .mpkg
      via <ce:packageType>app|mpkg</ce:packageType> (default is mpkg)
    - Feed items can be disabled via <ce:deployed>false</ce:deployed>; these
      items will not be considered for updates unless
      "[General] UpdateToUndeployed=1" is set the global config
    
    Unlike other Sparkle implementations the FeedURL cannot be updated via user
    preferences because we support multiple app packages with the same package
    identifier but different FeedURL settings on the same machine

    Fix small bug in timestamp smoothing for audio sources

    Fix small bug in timestamp smoothing for audio sources
    
    Due to a small error in the timestamp smoothing code the timestamp of
    audio packages that were too early was always set to the next expected
    timestamp, even if the difference was bigger than the smoothing threshold.
    
    This would cause obs to simply append all audio data to the buffer even if
    the real timestamp was way smaller than the next that was expected.
    
    This should reduce corruption problems with for example the pulseaudio
    plugin, which resends data under certain conditions.

    Force PulseAudio sample format if the source format is not supported by OBS
    
    If the sample format used by PulseAudio can not be converted into an
    OBS audio format it will be handled as AUDIO_FORMAT_UNKNOWN which will
    not result in a proper audio recording. So instead we request a format
    that OBS supports from PulseAudio and let it do the format conversion.

    audio timestamp, which seems like it was really meant for use with the
    pulse audio time rather than system time.
    
    Now, it just uses system time for timestamps.  Still might not be
    totally perfect, but seems to be much better than it was.
    
    This also removes the latency calculation.  Latency is no longer used
    because we're not using pulseaudio timing.

    libobs-d3d11: Don't depend on specific D3DCompiler
    
    I do not want the D3D11 library to depend on a specific compiler
    version.  This way, I do not have to distribute D3D Compiler libraries
    with the program (proprietary binary blobs).  Any particular version
    works because the API for the D3DCompiler function appears to be the
    same; the only things that change are other features and additions
    mostly (at least as far as I can tell).  Using any version available on
    the system should be more than sufficient rather than depending on some
    specific D3D compiler version.
    
    If the user doesn't have it, a download of the latest D3D distributables
    should be fine, though it should work with the ones that come with
    windows 7+ as well.

    (API Change) Remove pointers from all typedefs
    
    Typedef pointers are unsafe.  If you do:
    typedef struct bla *bla_t;
    then you cannot use it as a constant, such as: const bla_t, because
    that constant will be to the pointer itself rather than to the
    underlying data.  I admit this was a fundamental mistake that must
    be corrected.
    
    All typedefs that were pointer types will now have their pointers
    removed from the type itself, and the pointers will be used when they
    are actually used as variables/parameters/returns instead.
    
    This does not break ABI though, which is pretty nice.

    I feel like people keep mistaking how x264 preset functions.  They often
    associate it with their own CPU speed, and I feel the name does not help
    with that issue.  I think it may be for the best to just take it out.
    At best, it will keep people away from using it unless they know what
    they're doing, and at worst, people at least won't be able to associate
    it with their CPU as easily anymore.

    arch directories directly without modification.

    Replace ARB_separate_shader_objects extension
    
    This replaces the ARB_separate_shader_objects extension with traditional
    linked shaders.  I was able to get the existing system to use linked
    shaders without having to change any libobs graphics API.
    
    This essentially creates a linked list of shader programs with
    references to the shaders they link.  Before draw, it searches that
    linked list for a particular pixel/vertex shader pair, and the linked
    program associated with it.  If no matching program exists, it creates
    the program.

    Use helper function to set format in v4l2 input.
    
    Since the helper function also needs to pack/unpack the resolution, the
    pack/unpack functions were moved to the helper library and prefixed with
    v4l2_ in order to avoid possible collisions.

    Add cmake option to disable user interface
    
    Adds:
    ENABLE_UI (on by default) which makes it so that the UI is required, and
    will fail if a dependency is not found.  This is on by default because
    most people are building it with the user interface, and we'll probably
    get a lot of issue reports stating "why is there no executable?" if we
    don't have this on by default.
    
    DISABLE_UI which forces the UI off.
    
    If neither are set, then the UI will only be built if the dependencies
    for it are found, otherwise the UI will be be ignored.

    Do not explicitly set a default device in v4l2 input.
    
    This was added at a time where the source properties dialog did not
    pop up automatically on source creation. Now when the properties are
    displayed the first device in the select input will be selected by
    default if there was none already specified by the source settings.
    
    This will make the code cleaner and also save one redundant round of
    device enumeration.

    Fix device capability checking in v4l2 input.
    
    The capabilities flags that were used previously describe all
    capabilities the physical device offers. This would cause devices
    that are accessible through multiple device nodes to show up with
    all device nodes while only one of the nodes might actually offer
    the needed video capture capability.
    
    If the device has more nodes the CAP_DEVICES_CAP flag might be set
    in which case the device_caps field is filled with the capabilities
    that only apply to that specific node that is opened.

    This prevents certain issues I've encountered with devices where they
    expect to shut down in a specific thread they started up in, as well as
    a number of other issues, such as the configuration dialogs.
    
    The configuration dialogs require that a message loop be present, and
    this was not the case previously because everything was in the video
    thread, which has no windows-specific code.
    
    Configuration/crossbar/etc dialogs will now execute correctly.

    Remove audio/video sync reference counter
    
    This is actually unnecessary now that there's a hard limit on the
    maximum offset in which audio can be inserted.
    
    This also assumes too much about the audio; it assumes audio is always
    on, where as with some devices (such as the elgato) audio is not on
    until the stream starts, and when the video has already incremented the
    counter.

    Prevent audio too far from expected timing
    
    Audio that goes below the minimum expecting timing (current time -

    removed regardless of its delay.  This puts a hard cap of 6 seconds from
    current time that the maximum delay audio can have.  This will also
    prevent the circular buffer from dynamically growing too large.

    Perform timestamp smoothing in media-io as well
    
    Doing timestamp smoothing in obs-source.c is good because timestamps can
    typically operate on a different timebase, however, obs-source.c can
    also change that time base dynamically (such as with async video and
    unexpected timestamp jumps), so in order to ensure that audio is
    seamless in the output as well, perform timestamp smoothing in
    audio-io.c as well just as an extra precautionary measure.

    Basic UI: Reduce audio meter mute timing threshold
    
    Some devices burst their audio (such as when querying audio from
    directshow), and the 250 millisecond threshold that sets the audio meter
    back to muted status would erroneously cause the meter to appear bounce
    back between muted and unmuted.  Instead, a one second test should be
    sufficient time to prevent that from happening.

    Handle audio channels correctly in pulseaudio plugin

    Handle audio channels correctly in pulseaudio plugin
    
    This fixes a bug where the pulseaudio plugin always reported
    a speaker layout of stereo to obs, regardless of how many channels
    pulseaudio actually recorded.
    If the default number of channels was different to 2 this would
    cause audio distortion.

    Basic UI: Signal resize of properties view
    
    If the properties view changed in the properties window, the viewport of
    the properties would not trigger a resize because the size of the window
    itself does not change.  This creates a signal that allows the parent to
    know whether or not to update a viewport, if any.

    text-freetype2: Do not use fontconfig for mac
    
    Originally, I tested the fontconfig code on mac and it was working
    swimmingly.  However, it seems to be related to the fact that I am using
    the ports/homebrew version of fontconfig.  Most users do not have that
    version, and instead use the system built-in version of fontconfig,
    which apparently does not find any mac fonts..  at all.  So, this
    reverts the mac code to the older mac code we were using to manually
    find and associate fonts with font files on the mac.

    'veryfast' preset if the preset is invalid.

    Log total/skipped frames on output stop
    
    This makes it easier to do two things:
      1.) Get the skipped frames count relative to each specific output
      2.) Make it so that getting the 'current' log will always contain
          information about skipped frames.  Before, you'd have to force the
          user to restart the program and get the last log, which was really
          annoying when you just wanted to see how the encoders were
          performing.

    Fix freetype cmake module
    
    On fedora, the freetype cmake module would not find the correct
    location.  This is because it wasn't using the pkg-cofig include
    directory, which is different from the main ft2build.h header directory
    (which is /usr/include).
    
    This modification may be a good thing to do on all the cmake packages,
    actually.  Currently, they all just search for the location of a
    specific header, and ignore the pkg-config includes if they find it in
    specific hint locations.

    Fix gs_matrix_* issues
    
    Multiplication of the matricies was being done in the wrong direction.
    This caused source transformations to come out looking incorrect, for
    example the linux-xshm source's cursor would not be drawn correctly or
    in the right position if the source was moved/scaled/rotated.  The
    problem just turned out to be that the gs_matrix_* functions were
    multiplying in the wrong direction.  Reverse the direction of
    multiplication, and the problem is solved.

    Add system font lookup for mac/windows
    
    This changes the font plugin from using a font file to using a specific
    installed system font, which is searched for on each specific system and
    associated with the font file.  It now uses a font property instead of a
    path property, and font size has been removed because the font property
    now handles that.
    
    When the module is first loaded, it will build up a list of system fonts
    in order to be usable by Freetype.  It was quite painful to program this
    because font files can contain multiple localized versions of their face
    names, and then there was the issue where windows likes to mangle
    custom style types to the font name.  Regardless, it all seems to have
    worked out pretty well.
    
    Minor issues:
    - Truetype/Opentype fonts sometimes do not automatically have
      italic and/or bold styles available, it seems that the system applies
      transformations manually in those cases.  We don't do this yet,
      however, so right now a user might select a font with italic/bold
      only to discover that italic/bold doesn't always work.  Not entirely
      sure what to do about this yet.  There's probably a freetype function
      to do something like that somehow,
    
    This also requires that iconv be used for non-windows systems to be able
    to look up localized font names within font files.  Windows will use
    the win32 API and code page IDs to translate font names.

    Fix D3D11 render target blending issues
    
    The alpha source and destination blend values were always being set to
    one and zero, when they should have been set to the same as the color
    values.  This caused the alpha of the source texture to always overwrite
    the alpha of the destination texture, rather than apply the blend
    function upon it.  Needless to say that it seriously screwed up the
    render target if you rendered something with alpha on it.
    
    Thanks to paibox for pointing this issue out and yelling at me to fix
    it.  I apologize for not getting to this sooner.

    Plugins: Use new encoder/output size functions

    Add API functions for output/encoder scaling
    
    API functions added:
    -----------------------------------------------
    obs_output_set_preferred_size
    obs_output_get_width
    obs_output_get_height
    obs_encoder_set_scaled_size
    obs_encoder_get_width
    obs_encoder_get_height
    
    These functions allow for easier means of setting a custom resolution on
    an output or encoder.
    
    If an output uses an encoder and you set the preferred width/height
    using the output, then the output will attempt to set the scaled
    width/height for the encoder it's currently using.
    
    Outputs and encoders now should use these functions to determine the
    width/height of the raw frame data instead of using the video-io
    functions.

    video-io: Add function to just get video format

commit 72fbdc7eaaefcdba992e336785c22789b64babda
Author: jp9000 <obs.jim@gmail.com>
Date:   Sun Aug 10 12:49:44 2014 -0700

    Fix bug with automatic video scaling
    
    This is sort of hard to explain:  the scale_video_output function was
    overwriting the current frame.  If scaling was disabled, it would do
    nothing, and return success, and all would be well.  If it was enabled,
    it would then call the scaler, and then replace the contents of the
    'data' function parameter with the scaled frame data.  The problem with
    this is that I was passing video_output::cur_frame directly, which
    overwrites its previous value with the scaled frame data.  Then if
    cur_frame was not updated on time, it would end up trying to scale the
    previously scaled image, if that makes sense.  it would call the video
    scaler with the same from for both the source and destination.
    
    So the simple fix was to simply use a local variable and pass that in as
    a parameter to prevent this bug from occurring.

    (API Change) Use 'get' convention in libobs (base)
    
    Instead of having functions like obs_signal_handler() that can fail to
    properly specify their actual intent in the name (does it signal a
    handler, or does it return a signal handler?), always prefix functions
    that are meant to get information with 'get' to make its functionality
    more explicit.

    (API Change) Remove obs_graphics()
    
    API Removed:
    - graphics_t obs_graphics();
    Replaced With:
    - void obs_enter_graphics();
    - void obs_leave_graphics();
    
    Description:
      obs_graphics() was somewhat of a pointless function.  The only time
    that it was ever necessary was to pass it as a parameter to
    gs_entercontext() followed by a subsequent gs_leavecontext() call after
    that.  So, I felt that it made a bit more sense just to implement
    obs_enter_graphics() and obs_leave_graphics() functions to do the exact
    same thing without having to repeat that code.  There's really no need
    to ever "hold" the graphics pointer, though I suppose that could change
    in the future so having a similar function come back isn't out of the
    question.
    
    Still, this at least reduces the amount of unnecessary repeated code for
    the time being.

    (API Change) Split obs_source_gettype
    
    Changed:
    - obs_source_gettype
    To:
    - enum obs_source_type obs_source_get_type(obs_source_t source);
    - const char *obs_source_get_id(obs_source_t source);
    
    This function was inconsistent for a number of reasons.  First, it
    returns both the ID and the type of source (input/transition/filter),
    which is inconsistent with the name of "get type".  Secondly, the
    'squishy' naming convention which has just turned out to be bad
    practice and causes inconsistencies.  So it's now replaced with two
    functions that just return the type and the ID.

    Don't use "type" of source, use "id" of source
    
    The naming here is a poor choice, a source type determines if a source
    is either a regular input, a filter, or a transition.  The ID is the
    actual unique identifier of a source.

    The plugin now uses the generic name "OBS" to identify itself

    Until now the pulseaudio plugin used a placeholder icon for the
    mixer to display. Now that we have a real icon installed to the
    system we can use that instead.

    (API Change) Refactor module handling
    
    Changed API:
    - char *obs_find_plugin_file(const char *sub_path);
    
      Changed to: char *obs_module_file(const char *file);
    
      Cahnge it so you no longer need to specify a sub-path such as:
      obs_find_plugin_file("module_name/file.ext")
    
      Instead, now automatically handle the module data path so all you need
      to do is:
      obs_module_file("file.ext")
    
    - int obs_load_module(const char *name);
    
      Changed to: int obs_open_module(obs_module_t *module,
                                      const char *path,
                                      const char *data_path);
                  bool obs_init_module(obs_module_t module);
    
      Change the module loading API so that if the front-end chooses, it can
      load modules directly from a specified path, and associate a data
      directory with it on the spot.
    
      The module will not be initialized immediately; obs_init_module must
      be called on the module pointer in order to fully initialize the
      module.  This is done so a module can be disabled by the front-end if
      the it so chooses.
    
    New API:
    - void obs_add_module_path(const char *bin, const char *data);
    
      These functions allow you to specify new module search paths to add,
      and allow you to search through them, or optionally just load all
      modules from them.  If the string %module% is included, it will
      replace it with the module's name when that string is used as a
      lookup.  Data paths are now directly added to the module's internal
      storage structure, and when obs_find_module_file is used, it will look
      up the pointer to the obs_module structure and get its data directory
      that way.
    
      Example:
      obs_add_module_path("/opt/obs/my-modules/%module%/bin",
                          "/opt/obs/my-modules/%module%/data");
    
      This would cause it to additionally look for the binary of a
      hypthetical module named "foo" at /opt/obs/my-modules/foo/bin/foo.so
      (or libfoo.so), and then look for the data in
      /opt/obs/my-modules/foo/data.
    
      This gives the front-end more flexibility for handling third-party
      plugin modules, or handling all plugin modules in a custom way.
    
    - void obs_find_modules(obs_find_module_callback_t callback, void
                            *param);
    
      This searches the existing paths for modules and calls the callback
      function when any are found.  Useful for plugin management and custom
      handling of the paths by the front-end if desired.
    
    - void obs_load_all_modules(void);
    
      Search through the paths and both loads and initializes all modules
      automatically without custom handling.

    Reorganized data struct and update function for v4l2 plugin.
    
    Due to the plugin creating a thread to retrieve and output the
    captured image data, care must taken to not modify data the
    thread reads from the outside while the thread is running.
    
    In previous revisions some settings accessed by the capture
    thread were written to in the update function which could cause
    image corruption and in the worst case crashes.
    
    The members of the data struct are now split into two groups,
    those that are used by the thread while it is running and must
    not be changed from the outside, and those can be changed at any
    time.

    Add function to prepare frame structure to v4l2 plugin.
    
    This adds a function to prepare the source_frame struct for use
    with obs_source_output_video. Since all of the values except for
    the timestamp and data pointers are known in before it makes
    little sense to compute them over and over again.
    
    Due to the fact that v4l2 uses a single continuous memory segment
    for multi planar formats we can also precompute memory offsets for
    the planes.

    Minor refactor for creation of sub-windows
    
    This refactors the sub-window code a bit so that instead of deleting the
    window pointers, it calls QWidget::close() on them to safely trigger a
    normal close on them instead (which will also delete them).
    Moves setting the DeleteOnClose flag from inside of the Dialog classes
    into the OBSBasic class, to make that behaviour more obvious.

    Make application quit on main window close
    
    This causes the main window to signal the application to exit and delete
    its own pointer on close.  This fixes an issue where apparently some
    windows that aren't explicitly connected to the main window would be
    left open when the main window was closed because by default Qt will
    only exit when all windows have been closed.
    
    Because it deletes its own pointer, instead of storing it in a
    std::unique_ptr, use a QPointer because it has an internal mechanism for
    automatically tracking QObject deletion even if the deletion was not
    done on the QPointer itself, where as unique_ptr does not have that
    functionality.  In other words, if the pointer is deleted elsewhere for
    whatever reason, the QPointer will still set that internal pointer value
    to null.

    bad video device parameters, the front-end needs to know that.
    
    The OBS Basic UI has also been updated to reflect this API change.

    Allow copying of all dependencies (windows only)
    
    If the cmake user variable COPY_DEPENDENCIES is set, this script will
    make it so that a windows build will automatically copy all required
    dependencies (FFmpeg, x264, and Qt5) to the respective
    additional_install_files\exec(32|64) directory.  This makes it much
    easier to set up a development environment on windows, and much easier
    to make usable test builds.
    
    It will also copy the appropriate Direct3D compiler DLL, along with
    dependencies of dependencies (the icu*.dll and EGL/GLES files for Qt)

    There's no need to find DirectX because with VS2013 and mingw it's
    already available by default.  Older visual studio versions that didn't
    come with DirectX by default are no longer supported anyway.
    
    (Also mingw doesn't currently work at all due to lack of proper headers,
    but once they do it'll be available in the same way.  I think.)

    No need to initialize map value to 0 (bug fix)
    
    There's no need to initialize the map value to 0.  What was happening is
    that obs_scene_add was adding a ref to a non-existent value, which
    simply created it and added 1, which is perfectly fine.  Then,
    obs_add_source would set the ref to 0, overwriting the existing value.
    
    So this meant that if you didn't call them in the right order, it
    wouldn't work properly, and would break, which was pretty stupid.
    
    Turns out that if you access a map value that doesn't exist, it'll
    create one with the default constructor of that type.  In this case, int
    will initialize to 0, which was exactly what we wanted in the first
    place, and defeats the purpose of even needing to initialize the value
    to 0.  So, there's no need to manually set it to 0 in
    OBSBasic::SourceAdded, or worry about the order in which the functions
    are called.
    
    Just goes to show you have to be careful with reference counting.

    Add fallback sizes and framerates to v4l2 plugin.
    
    Until a proper fix is found to support devices that use stepwise
    or continuous values for framesize and framerate this adds fixed
    values that can be selected.
    For devices that support discrete values those are still queried
    and used.

    Remove '32bit' text from 32bit windows version
    
    Users of the 32bit version need to realize that it doesn't really matter
    all that much.

    It's a sad day when I realize that I did not add any null pointer
    checking to any of the functions in this file.  Discovered it while
    checking all the different languages, happened when there was a missing
    locale file for a certain module that hadn't had the language uploaded
    yet.

    libobs: Add macro for default module locale
    
    These macros are used as easy helper functions to load/unload module
    locale that's based upon the text_lookup system.  You simple place the
    OBS_MODULE_USE_DEFAULT_LOCALE macro once in the module, call
    OBS_MODULE_FREE_DEFAULT LOCALE in obs_module_unload, and then
    call obs_module_text anywhere in your module where you need to look up
    text.
    
    By default, it will look for a locale directory in your module's data
    directory, and look for language files within it (INI locale format)

    libobs: Add function for default module locale
    
    This function is used to simplify the process when using the default
    locale handling for modules.  It will automatically search in the plugin
    data directory associated with the specific module specified, load the
    default locale text (for example english if its default language is
    english), and then it will load the set locale on top of the default
    locale, which will cause text to use the default locale if the desired
    locale text is not found.

    The OBSBasic class is getting a bit big, so I separated out the

    The delete operator can be called on a null pointer, so there's no
    reason for these tests.

    If reconnecting, ignore the disconnect code
    
    Usually if you are reconnecting after network outage, it will give a
    different code (such as OBS_OUTPUT_CONNECT_FAILED).  So, if already
    reconnecting, ignore the code unless it's OBS_OUTPUT_SUCCESS.

    Implement function to reset blend state
    
    I was implementing a pushing/popping attributes function like with GL,
    but I realized that for our particular purposes (and actually for most
    purposes) its usage was somewhat..  niche.  I may still implement
    pushing/popping of attributes in the future, though right now I feel
    using a function to reset the state is sufficient for our purposes.

    Remove unnecessary context initialization code
    
    There was no need to call the context free function in the
    initialization function, and it's safer to just initialize the memory to
    0 before using (which also negates the need for da_init)

    Add rename cache for thread safety
    
    This just ensures that if an obs object is renamed that the pointer to
    older names will still be valid.  Prevents renames from causing any
    invalid memory access.
    
    When the obs object is destroyed, so are the cached names.

    Implement reconnecting
    
    The core itself now provides reconnection options (enabled by default, 2
    second timeout between reconnects, 20 retries max until actual
    disconnection occurs).  This will make things easier for both module
    developers and UI developers.
    
    Reconnecting treats the stream as though it were still active, and
    signals are sent when reconnecting and upon successful reconnection.
    
    Need to implement user interface information for reconnections.

    Implement high encoder CPU usage handling
    
    This implements the 'frame skipping' mechanism to forcibly cause frames
    to be duplicated in order to reduce encoder complexity so the encoder
    can catch up to the video, otherwise it will continue to be
    progressively behind and will cause a desync of the video.
    
    Typically, if a user gets this issue, they should turn down their
    settings.  For the love of god do not tell them that 'frames are
    skipping', just tell them that CPU usage is high, and that they should
    consider turning down their settings.

    Add module callbacks for loading locale data
    
    The module callback obs_module_set_locale will be called after loading
    the module, and any time the locale is manually changed via core API.
    
    When this function is called, the module is expected to load new text
    lookup values for all the text it uses based upon the current locale.

    Remove 'locale' parameter from all callbacks
    
    The locale parameter was a mistake, because it puts extra needless
    burden upon the module developer to have to handle this variable for
    each and every single callback function.  The parameter is being removed
    in favor of a single centralized module callback function that
    specifically updates locale information for a module only when needed.

    Make settings window only save data that changes
    
    Currently, if a user presses 'OK' or 'Apply' on the settings window, it
    will save all data from all controls on a settings pane, regardless of
    whether of not they were changed.  The major issue with this is that
    setting the data will overwrite all default values, making it impossible
    for default values to be used if a user didn't actually change a value.
    (Thanks to palana for pointing this fact out)
    
    So instead, mark a control as 'changed' using QObject::property() and
    QObject::sender(), and add a few helper functions to controls to ensure
    that they are checked to see whether they were actually changed directly
    by the user before saving the value to the config.

    Do not clamp aspect by default when using bounds
    
    If the scene item has a bounding box set up for it, do not make it use
    aspect ratio clamping by default.
    
    Instead, make it so that shift will turn on aspect ratio, and make it
    also apply to all types of bounding box modes.
    
    The only time where aspect ratio clamping should apply by default is
    when bounds are not in use (i.e. when a source is just created).  Some
    will disagree with me just because that's how photoshop does it, but
    we're not photoshop, and I feel that the majority of users will have
    more trouble with it disabled by default than enabled by default.
    
    So to sum it up:
    
    If bounds inactive, clamp aspect ratio by default, because scene items
    start out with it inactive, and it directly affects the scale.
    
    If bounds active, do not clamp aspect ratio by default, because clamping
    to aspect ratio doesn't particularly have an effect for mode bounds
    modes except for "stretch to bounds".

    Instead of using bounds to force the source to be centered (and
    unrotated), just center the source positionally on the screen.  Will
    also preserve rotation.

    UI:  Change transform value 'scale' to 'size'
    
    There's no reason to represent this value in terms of scale.  Scale is a
    useless value for users to use.  What are they going to enter, 0.5?
    2.0?  0.25?
    
    Even if it can be subject to change by the source itself, and even if
    it's still converted to scale internally, having it display the base
    source size value is much more ideal for the user.

    linux-xshm:  Fix cursor draw position
    
    Due to the recent change with matrices, the way space is represented by
    matrices is a bit different.  The matrix stack represents the view
    matrix, rather than the model matrix, so the position is more
    representative of the camera (view) itself, rather than that of the
    objects (model).

    rtmp-common: Apply service encoder settings
    
    Common services that require specific encoder settings (specified in the
    'recommended' section of the json file) will now have those encoder
    settings applied before the encoders start up.
    
    This fixes the issue with services like twitch that weren't getting
    their required 2-second keyframe maximum interval set.

    depending on whether that encoder is active or not.

    UI:  Add scene editing
    
    So, scene editing was interesting (and by interesting I mean
    excruciating).  I almost implemented 'manipulator' visuals (ala 3dsmax
    for example), and used 3 modes for controlling position/rotation/size,
    but in a 2D editing, it felt clunky, so I defaulted back to simply
    click-and-drag for movement, and then took a similar though slightly
    different looking approach for handling scaling and reszing.
    
    I also added a number of menu item helpers related to positioning,
    scaling, rotating, flipping, and resetting the transform back to
    default.
    
    There is also a new 'transform' dialog (accessible via menu) which will
    allow you to manually edit every single transform variable of a scene
    item directly if desired.
    
    If a scene item does not have bounds active, pulling on the sides of a
    source will cause it to resize it via base scale rather than by the
    bounding box system (if the source resizes that scale will apply).  If
    bounds are active, it will modify the bounding box only instead.
    
    How a source scales when a bounding box is active depends on the type of
    bounds being used.  You can set it to scale to the inner bounds, the
    outer bounds, scale to bounds width only, scale to bounds height only,
    and a setting to stretch to bounds (which forces a source to always draw
    at the bounding box size rather than be affected by its internal size).
    You can also set it to be used as a 'maximum' size, so that the source
    doesn't necessarily get scaled unless it extends beyond the bounds.
    
    Like in OBS1, objects will snap to the edges unless the control key is
    pressed.  However, this will now happen even if the object is rotated or
    oriented in any strange way.  Snapping will also occur when stretching
    or changing the bounding box size.

    Scenes:  Implement more item positioning features
    
    There are a ridiculous number of features related to scaling and
    positioning due to requests by a number of people who complained that
    they hated the way that OBS1 would always resize their sources when the
    source's base size changed.  There were also people who wanted more
    control for how the resizing was handled, or the ability to completely
    prevent resizing entirely if desired.  So I made it so that you can
    optionally use a 'bounds' system, which allows you to specify different
    styles of controlling resizing.
    
    If disabled, the source will always automatically resize and only the
    base scale is applied.  If enabled, you have a variety of different ways
    to limit/control how it can resize within the bounds, or make it so it
    can't resize at all.  You can also control alignment within that
    bounding box, so you can make it so that a source always aligns to a
    side or corner of the box.
    
    I also added an alignment value which changes how the source is oriented
    relative to the position of the scene item.  For example, setting
    bottom-right alignment will make it so that the position of the item is
    the bottom right corner of the source.  When the source resizies, it
    will resize leftward and upward in that case, which solves the problem
    of how a source resizes relative to a desired position.

    Allow signal callback deletion while signalling
    
    I encountered a situation where I wanted to delete a callback for a
    signal while inside of that signal.  However it would hard lock, and
    even after that, it would mess up the loop for the callback list.
    
    So, change the mutex of the individual signals to a recursive-style
    mutex, and then if a callback of a signal is deleted while currently in
    that signal, just mark it for deletion, which will happen after the
    signal is complete.

    CoreAudio: Enumerate AudioDeviceID manually
    
    Apparently, despite the fact that Apple added
    kAudioHardwarePropertyTranslateUIDToDevice in 10.8, it's not actually
    usable in 10.8, only 10.9.  So, instead of being able to use it like a
    normal, sane person, we have to enumerate all devices manually and find
    the AudioDeviceID ourselves.  A slight annoyance and a mark against
    apple's competence, but audio devices should now be working again on
    10.8 at least, so whatever.

    UI: Add new volume meter handling
    
    This adds support for the more smooth volume levels that accounts for
    both level and magnitude.  Currently, it just averages level and
    magnitude, later on a full audio meter control can be made that would
    properly utilize level, magnitude, and peak.
    
    Also cleaned up the code a bit and removed some trailing whitespace.

    libobs: Add level/magnitude/peak volume levels
    
    This replaces the older code which simply queried the max volume level
    value for any given audio.
    
    I'm still not 100% sure on if this is how I want to approach the
    problem, particularly, whether this should be done in obs_source or in
    audio_line, but it can always be moved later if needed.
    
    This uses the calculations by the awesome Bill Hamilton that OBS1 used
    for its volume levels.  It calculates the current max (level),
    magnitude, and current peak.  This data then can be used to create
    awesome volume meter controls later on.
    
    NOTE: Will probably need optimization, does one float at a time right
    now.
    
    Also, change some of the naming conventions.  I actually need to change
    a lot of the naming conventions in general so that all words are
    separated by underscores.  Kind of a bad practice there on my part.

    win-dshow module: Fix configuration issues
    
    The biggest problem with DirectShow is that available configuration
    capabilities can change if you so much as look at it the wrong way.
    
    Previously, configuring devices often didn't configure the device
    settings correctly, you would choose one setting and then another
    setting wouldn't be compatible with that settings.
    
    Let's take the terrible microsoft lifecam series for example.  First,
    you'd be at 640x480 happily webcam'ing away, which is using the YUY2
    format.  Then you decide "hey, this webcam resolution is a bit low.  I
    would love to have it a bit high resolution so it's a bit more crisp and
    clear."  You'd select 1280x720, and then suddenly the only format
    supported is MJPEG output.  However, the interface has to update that
    fact, it can't list YUY2 if MJPEG is the only one available for this
    resolution.  This doesn't just apply to formats either, this applies to
    framerates and such as well.  Some framerates will only be supported by
    certain resolutions which can in turn only be supported by certain
    formats.
    
    This causes user interface for configuration to be really be a nightmare
    to manage if you want these features to be available to the user.  It's
    extremely annoying because you have to update all the configuration UI
    after something has changed, double check the configuration values, and
    if the values aren't supported, update those configuration values.

    libobs/util:  Fix string conversion functions
    
    There was a fundamental flaw with the string type conversion functions
    where the sizes were not being properly accounted for.  They were using
    the 'len' value as a value for the output rather than only for the
    input, which was bad because the output could have more or less
    characters than the input.

    libobs: Init source info before calling 'create'
    
    When a source's private data is being created by a module, it wasn't
    able to call most source functions because most functions rely on the
    obs_source_info part of the context to be set.  This fixes that issue.
    
    It was strange that this wasn't already the case because the other
    context types already did the same thing.

    libobs:  Add planar 4:2:0 async texture support
    
    This uses the reverse planar YUV 4:2:0 conversion shader to output a YUV
    texture without having to convert it via CPU.  Again, this will reduce
    video upload bandwidth usage to 37.5% of the original rate.  I suspect
    this will be particularly useful for when an FFmpeg or libav input
    plugin for playing videos is made.
    
    NOTE: There's an issue with certain texture sizes right now I haven't
    been able to identify, if the full size of texture data divided by the
    base texture width is an uneven number, the V chroma plane seems like it
    can potentially shift, though I only had this happen with 160x90
    resolution C920.  Almost all resolutions tend to be even.  Needs further
    testing with more devices that support planar YUV 4:2:0 output.

    UI: Add FLV file output (sharing encoders)
    
    Implement the 'file path' in output settings, and implement the 'start
    recording' button, though for the time being I'm just going to make it
    use a directory rather than allow custom file names.
    
    This file output will actually share the video and audio encoder with
    the stream.
    
    I don't really know what to do about MP4 -- I don't really like the idea
    of saving directly in the program, if you do and the program crashes,
    that MP4 file is lost.  I'm contemplating making some sort of mp4 output
    process stub.  So no MP4 file output for the time being.
    
    If you need MP4, just remux it with FFmpeg:
    
    ffmpeg -i flv_file.flv -acodec copy -vcodec copy mp4_file.mp4

    This doesn't add FLV file output to the user interface yet, but we'll
    get around to that eventually.  This just adds an FLV output type.
    
    Also, removed ftello/fseeko because off_t is a really annoying data
    type, and I'd rather have a firm int64_t for large sizes, so I named it
    to os_fseeki64 and os_ftelli64 instead, and changed the file size
    function to return an int64_t.

    Add 'source selection' dialog
    
    Add a 'source selection' dialog to replace the 'enter a name' dialog.
    This new dialog allows you to make new instances of pre-existing sources
    so that you can add a pre-existing source to a different scene, or in to
    the same scene more than once.
    
    Also started implementing locale.
    
    Comtemplating switching to JSON-based locale later, so we can add things
    like descriptions/disambiguation, and so we can use jansson's built-in
    hash table when doing the string lookup.

    obs-source.c:  Fix a few potential concerns
    
    First, if the private data of the source fails to be created, then do
    not destroy the source.  If the source is destroyed, all the user's data
    associated with that source is lost, which could end up being a
    potential problem.  Instead, let it linger as a 'dead' source until the
    user chooses to fix the problem (though this should never really happen,
    the source module functions should be programmed to handle this
    scenario)
    
    Secondly, rename new_frame_ready to ready_async_frame, and fix a
    potential memory leak with it.

    Fix an issue with async (video) source destruction
    
    obs_source_output_video can cause cached frames to be freed twice if

    effects; freeing the source private data right after the destroy signal
    has been processed ensures proper behavior

       and load the data on startup.
    
     - Make it so that a scene is created by default if first time using the
       application.  On certain operating systems where supported, a default
       capture will be created.  Desktop capture on mac, particularly.  Not
       sure what to do about windows because monitor capture on windows 7 is
       completely terrible and is bad to start users off with.

    D3D11:  Fix constant position code for good
    
    I had forgotten how constants worked when compiled; constants are
    uploaded as constant registers.  When constants are used with shaders,
    multiple constants are often packed in to a single register when
    possible to reduce constant register count.
    
    For example, one 'float' constant and one 'float3' constant will be
    packed in to a single register (c0.x for constant 1, c0.yzw for constant
    2), but two 'float' constants and one 'float3' constant must inhabit two
    registers (c0.xy for constant 1, c1.xyz for constant 2), so it must
    start on a new register boundry (every 16 bytes).
    
    I had first instinctively thought it was just a simple case of
    alignment like it is on the CPU, but then I realized that it didn't
    sound right, so I went back and did some more tests and then ultimately
    remembered how constants actually are uploaded.

    Make workaround for VS2012/2013 debugging issue
    
    Starting with VS2012, microsoft made a terribly stupid change to the way
    working directory is handled.  It basically will not work properly if
    you need to run your executable from a specific location, it would only
    run properly from debug if you also had your target directory set to an
    environment variable, which was incredibly stupid.  The visual studio
    development team is run by chimpanzees with tiny brains, headed by
    a broken AI core designed by gilbert gottfried.
    
    I made a workaround for it so that it's much easier to set up debugging
    in VS2013, so that all you need to do is enter in the the working
    directory for it to work properly.  Still somewhat of a pain but the Qt
    addin kept overwriting the god forsaken environment path, and made
    setting it up much more difficult than it was supposed to be.

    If a source with async video wasn't currently active, it would endlessly

    Add preliminary saving/loading of scene/sources
    
    This saves scenes/sources from json on exit, and properly loads it back
    up when starting up the program again, as well as the currently active
    scene.
    
    I had to add a 'load' and 'save' callback to the source interface
    structure because I realizes that certain sources (such as scenes)
    operate different with their saved data; scenes for example would have
    to keep track of their settings information constantly, and that was
    somewhat unacceptable to make it functional.
    
    The optional 'load' callback will be called only after having loaded
    setttings specifically from file/imported data, and the 'save' function
    will be called only specifically when data actually needs to be saved.
    
    I also had to adjust the obs_scene code so that it's a regular input
    source type now, and I also modified it so that it doesn't have some
    strange custom creation code anymore.  The obs_scene_create function is
    now simply just a wrapper for obs_source_create.  You could even create
    a scene with obs_source_create manually as well.

    Improve output packet interleaving
    
    The 'wait' constant was a terrible means of trying to ensure that the
    packets were interleaved.  Instead, calculate the current highest
    timestamps of each encoder that's present in the interleaved buffer, and
    use that as a means of detecting whether the current packet should be
    sent off.  This will guarantee sorting without relying on some arbirary
    constant that 'assumes' that it'll be interleaved.  It also reduces
    buffering any more than what is needed to interleave.

    Adjust the way properties view UI displays
    
    It didn't really look very nice in most cases and the controls were
    always compacted, doing this makes it look a bit better.
    
    Also change it so the properties window shows the properties on the
    bottom below the source rather than to the right, seeing as in most
    cases the source has a greater width than height, and it feels just a
    little bit better to look at (thought that's just my opinion).
    
    Controls still stretch really far sometimes though, I wonder what should
    be done about that to be honest.  Maybe prevent it from scrolling to the
    right?

    Added a wrapping library for pulseaudio
    
    The wrapping library uses a global mainloop and context which
    allows operations to share the connection. The global mainloop
    is created and destroyed based on internal reference counting.
    
    The capture code won't spawn a new thread for each input anymore
    but instead just create the recording stream and rely on the
    threaded mainloop to execute the read callback when data is available.

    obs-studio UI:  Implement stream settings UI
    
     - Updated the services API so that it links up with an output and
       the output gets data from that service rather than via settings.
       This allows the service context to have control over how an output is
       used, and makes it so that the URL/key/etc isn't necessarily some
       static setting.
    
       Also, if the service is attached to an output, it will stick around
       until the output is destroyed.
    
     - The settings interface has been updated so that it can allow the
       usage of service plugins.  What this means is that now you can create
       a service plugin that can control aspects of the stream, and it
       allows each service to create their own user interface if they create
       a service plugin module.
    
     - Testing out saving of current service information.  Saves/loads from
       JSON in to obs_data_t, seems to be working quite nicely, and the
       service object information is saved/preserved on exit, and loaded
       again on startup.
    
     - I agonized over the settings user interface for days, and eventually
       I just decided that the only way that users weren't going to be
       fumbling over options was to split up the settings in to simple/basic
       output, pre-configured, and then advanced for advanced use (such as
       multiple outputs or services, which I'll implement later).
    
       This was particularly painful to really design right, I wanted more
       features and wanted to include everything in one interface but
       ultimately just realized from experience that users are just not
       technically knowledgable about it and will end up fumbling with the
       settings rather than getting things done.
    
       Basically, what this means is that casual users only have to enter in
       about 3 things to configure their stream:  Stream key, audio bitrate,
       and video bitrate.  I am really happy with this interface for those
       types of users, but it definitely won't be sufficient for advanced
       usage or for custom outputs, so that stuff will have to be separated.
    
     - Improved the JSON usage for the 'common streaming services' context,
       I realized that JSON arrays are there to ensure sorting, while
       forgetting that general items are optimized for hashing.  So
       basically I'm just using arrays now to sort items in it.

    then a 'custom' service that allows you to enter in the stream URL and
    key manually, without a service/server list.

    that it's located in the vs/2013 directory, so that other libraries can
    properly link with it without having to enter in extra information just
    to include jansson

    libobs:  Add services API, reduce repeated code
    
    Add API for streaming services.  The services API simplifies the
    creation of custom service features and user interface.
    
    Custom streaming services later on will be able to do things such as:
    
     - Be able to use service-specific APIs via modules, allowing a more
       direct means of communicating with the service and requesting or
       setting service-specific information
    
     - Get URL/stream key via other means of authentication such as OAuth,
       or be able to build custom URLs for services that require that sort
       of thing.
    
     - Query information (such as viewer count, chat, follower
       notifications, and other information)
    
     - Set channel information (such as current game, current channel title,
       activating commercials)
    
    Also, I reduce some repeated code that was used for all libobs objects.
    This includes the name of the object, the private data, settings, as
    well as the signal and procedure handlers.
    
    I also switched to using linked lists for the global object lists,
    rather than using an array of pointers (you could say it was..
    pointless.)  ..Anyway, the linked list info is also stored in the shared
    context data structure.

    OpenGL: Fix swizzle code again for alpha textures
    
    My prior code was incorrect;  I mixed up the two parameters, the
    GL_TEXTURE_SWIZZLE_* parameter specifies the target channel, and the
    value itself specifies the source channel.,  If that makes sense.

    Fix drawing bug with async video sources
    
    Before, async video sources would flicker because they were only being
    drawn when they were updated.  So when updated, they'd draw that frame,
    then it would stop drawing it until it updated again.  This fixes that
    issue and they should now draw properly.
    
    Also, fix a few other minor bugs and issues relating to async video,
    and make it so that non-async video filters can be properly applied to
    them.
    
    For the purposes of testing, change the 'test-random' source to an async
    video source that updates every quarter of a second with a new random
    face.
    
    Also fix a bug where non-async video sources wouldn't have filter
    effects applied properly.

    RTMP output: Implement frame drop code
    
    A little bit of history about frame dropping:
    
    I did a large number of experiments with frame dropping in old versions
    of OBS1, and it's not an easy thing to deal with.  I tried just about
    everything from standard i-frame delay, to large buffers, to dumping
    packets, to super-unnecessarily-complex things that just ended up
    causing more problems than they was worth.
    
    When I did my experiments, I found that the most ideal frame drop system
    (in terms of reducing the amount of total data that needed to be
    dropped) was in the 0.4xx days where I had a 3 second frame-drop buffer
    where I could calculate the actual buffer size in bytes, and then
    intellgently choose packets in that buffer to trim it down to a specific
    size while minimizing the number of p-frames and i-frames dropped, and
    preventing the actual impact of dropped frames on the stream.  The
    downside of it was that it required too much extra latency, and far too
    many people complained about it, so it was removed in favor of the
    current system.
    
    The current system I just refer to just as 'packet dumping', which when
    combined with low keyframe intervals (like most services use these
    days), is the next-best method from my experience.  Just dump the buffer
    when you reach a threshold of buffering (which I prefer to measure with
    time rather than in size), then wait for a new i-frame.  Simple,
    effective, and reduces the risk of consecutive buffering, while still
    having fairly low impact on the stream output due to the low keyframe
    interval of services.
    
    By the way, audio will not (and should not ever) be dropped, lest you
    end up with syncing issues (among other nasty things) specific to server
    implementation.

    OpenGL: Use texture swizzle for BGRA/BGR/A8
    
    On some operating systems, with specific drivers it seems that BGR/BGRA
    isn't properly treated as such in certain cases.  This fix will
    hopefully force the formats to be treated as BGR/BGRA when actually
    rendering, which should get around the implementation-specific issue.

    Fix issue when using multiple video encoders
    
     - Fix an issue that could occur when using more than one video encoder.
       Audio/video would not sync up correctly because they were expected to
       be paired with a particular encoder.  This simply adds a little
       helper variable to encoder packets that specifies the system time in
       microseconds.  We then use that system time to sync
    
     - Fix an issue with x264 with fractional FPS rates (29.97 and 59.94
       particularly) where it would create ridiculously large stream
       outputs.  The problem was that you shouldn't set the timebase_*
       variables in the x264 params manually, let x264 handle the default
       values for it and leave them at 0.
    
     - Make x264 use CFR output, because there's no reason to ever use VFR
       in this case.

    Implement RTMP module (still needs drop code)
    
     - Implement the RTMP output module.  This time around, we just use a
       simple FLV muxer, then just write to the stream with RTMP_Write.
       Easy and effective.
    
     - Fix the FLV muxer, the muxer now outputs proper FLV packets.
    
     - Output API:
       * When using encoders, automatically interleave encoded packets
         before sending it to the output.
    
       * Pair encoders and have them automatically wait for the other to
         start to ensure sync.
    
       * Change 'obs_output_signal_start_fail' to 'obs_output_signal_stop'
         because it was a bit confusing, and doing this makes a lot more
         sense for outputs that need to stop suddenly (disconnections/etc).
    
     - Encoder API:
       * Remove some unnecessary encoder functions from the actual API and
         make them internal.  Most of the encoder functions are handled
         automatically by outputs anyway, so there's no real need to expose
         them and end up inadvertently confusing plugin writers.
    
       * Have audio encoders wait for the video encoder to get a frame, then
         start at the exact data point that the first video frame starts to
         ensure the most accrate sync of video/audio possible.
    
       * Add a required 'frame_size' callback for audio encoders that
         returns the expected number of frames desired to encode with.  This
         way, the libobs encoder API can handle the circular buffering
         internally automatically for the encoder modules, so encoder
         writers don't have to do it themselves.
    
     - Fix a few bugs in the serializer interface.  It was passing the wrong
       variable for the data in a few cases.
    
     - If a source has video, make obs_source_update defer the actual update
       callback until the tick function is called to prevent threading
       issues.

    allocation counter variable.  The allocation counter now always should
    have the correct value.

    Add FFmpeg's AAC enoder
    
    This just adds FFmpeg's default AAC encoder as an audio encoder.  Going
    to try to start getting things going with the RTMP output library next.

    Add packet interleaving and improve encoder API
    
     - Add interleaving of video/audio packets for outputs that are encoded
       and expect both video and audio data, sorting the packets and sending
       them to the output when both video and audio is received.
    
     - Combine create and initialize callbacks for the encoder API callback
       interface.

    Improve properties API
    
    Improve the properties API so that it can actually respond somewhat to
    user input.  Maybe later this might be further improved or replaced with
    something script-based.
    
    When creating a property, you can now add a callback to that property
    that notifies when the property has been changed in the user interface.
    Return true if you want the properties to be refreshed, or false if not.
    Though now that I think about it I doubt there would ever be a case
    where you would have this callback and *not* refresh the properties.
    
    Regardless, this allows functions to change the values of properties or
    settings, or enable/disable/hide other property controls from view
    dynamically.

    This commit contains more than I intended. Read below for more info.
    
    1) Fixed the preview window. It now correctly displays the source.
    2) The GLX backend now correctly uses the devices current swap.
    3) We now set device->cur_swap to a default so we don't have to check it in every function.
    4) Minor syntactical cleanups and perhaps some messiness added.

    This unfortunately re-introduces undesirable rendering behaviour for

    renderer) when the property window is open, but fixes property window
    preview rendering for sufficiently fast renderers

    Add preliminary FLV/RTMP output (incomplete)
    
     - obs-outputs module:  Add preliminary code to send out data, and add
       an FLV muxer.  This time we don't really need to build the packets
       ourselves, we can just use the FLV muxer and send it directly to
       RTMP_Write and it should automatically parse the entire stream for us
       without us having to do much manual code at all.  We'll see how it
       goes.
    
     - libobs:  Add AVC NAL packet parsing code
    
     - libobs/media-io:  Add quick helper functions for audio/video to get
       the width/height/fps/samplerate/etc rather than having to query the
       info structures each time.
    
     - libobs (obs-output.c):  Change 'connect' signal to 'start' and 'stop'
       signals.  'start' now specifies an error code rather than whether it
       simply failed, that way the client can actually know *why* a failure
       occurred.  Added those error codes to obs-defs.h.
    
     - libobs:  Add a few functions to duplicate/free encoder packets

    Note that this is a somewhat heavily modified custom version of librtmp.
    I modified all the platform specific code that we were using for the
    OBS1 to make it platform-independent.
    
    I don't really like the code in this library, but it works well enough,
    so I can't really fault anyone for it.  It's just very..  unclean.  Even
    for a C library, quite unclean.  Some parts are also a little less safe
    than I'd prefer as well.

       context-specific object, such as the D3D texture pointer, or the
       OpenGL texture object handle.
    
     - Also cleaned up the export stuff.  I realized it was all totally
       superfluous.  Kind of a dumb moment, but nice to clean it up
       regardless.

    Implement encoder usage with outputs
    
     - Make it so that encoders can be assigned to outputs.  If an encoder
       is destroyed, it will automatically remove itself from that output.
       I specifically didn't want to do reference counting because it leaves
       too much potential for unchecked references and it just felt like it
       would be more trouble than it's worth.
    
     - Add a 'flags' value to the output definition structure.  This lets
       the output specify if it uses video/audio, and whether the output is
       meant to be used with OBS encoders or not.
    
     - Remove boilerplate code for outputs.  This makes it easier to program
       outputs.  The boilerplate code involved before was mostly just
       involving connecting to the audio/video data streams directly in each
       output plugin.
    
       Instead of doing that, simply add plugin callback functions for
       receiving video/audio (either encoded or non-encoded, whichever it's
       set to use), and then call obs_output_begin_data_capture and
       obs_output_end_data_capture to automatically handle setting up
       connections to raw or encoded video/audio streams for the plugin.
    
     - Remove 'active' function from output callbacks, as it's no longer
       really needed now that the libobs output context automatically knows
       when the output is active or not.
    
     - Make it so that an encoder cannot be destroyed until all data
       connections to the encoder have been removed.
    
     - Change the 'start' and 'stop' functions in the encoder interface to
       just an 'initialize' callback, which initializes the encoder.
    
     - Make it so that the encoder must be initialized first before the data
       stream can be started.  The reason why initialization was separated
       from starting the encoder stream was because we need to be able to
       check that the settings used with the encoder *can* be used first.
    
       This problem was especially annoying if you had both video/audio
       encoding.  Before, you'd have to check the return value from
       obs_encoder_start, and if that second encoder fails, then you
       basically had to stop the first encoder again, making for
       unnecessary boilerplate code whenever starting up two encoders.

    Add source properties window (very preliminary)
    
     - Add a properties window for sources so that you can now actually edit
       the settings for sources.  Also, display the source by itself in the
       window (Note: not working on mac, and possibly not working on linux).
    
       When changing the settings for a source, it will call
       obs_source_update on that source when you have modified any values
       automatically.
    
     - Add a properties 'widget', eventually I want to turn this in to a
       regular nice properties view like you'd see in the designer, but
       right now it just uses a form layout in a QScrollArea with regular
       controls to display the properties.  It's clunky but works for the
       time being.
    
     - Make it so that swap chains and the main graphics subsystem will
       automatically use at least one backbuffer if none was specified
    
     - Fix bug where displays weren't added to the main display array
    
     - Make it so that you can get the properties of a source via the actual
       pointer of a source/encoder/output in addition to being able to look
       up properties via identifier.
    
     - When registering source types, check for required functions (wasn't
       doing it before).  getheight/getwidth should not be optional if it's
       a video source as well.
    
     - Add an RAII OBSObj wrapper to obs.hpp for non-reference-counted
       libobs pointers
    
     - Add an RAII OBSSignal wrapper to obs.hpp for libobs signals to
       automatically disconnect them on destruction
    
     - Move the "scale and center" calculation in window-basic-main.cpp to
       its own function and in its own source file
    
     - Add an 'update' callback to WASAPI audio sources

    Implement encoder interface (still preliminary)
    
     - Implement OBS encoder interface.  It was previously incomplete, but
       now is reaching some level of completion, though probably should
       still be considered preliminary.
    
       I had originally implemented it so that encoders only have a 'reset'
       function to reset their parameters, but I felt that having both a
       'start' and 'stop' function would be useful.
    
       Encoders are now assigned to a specific video/audio media output each
       rather than implicitely assigned to the main obs video/audio
       contexts.  This allows separate encoder contexts that aren't
       necessarily assigned to the main video/audio context (which is useful
       for things such as recording specific sources).  Will probably have
       to do this for regular obs outputs as well.
    
       When creating an encoder, you must now explicitely state whether that
       encoder is an audio or video encoder.
    
       Audio and video can optionally be automatically converted depending
       on what the encoder specifies.
    
       When something 'attaches' to an encoder, the first attachment starts
       the encoder, and the encoder automatically attaches to the media
       output context associated with it.  Subsequent attachments won't have
       the same effect, they will just start receiving the same encoder data
       when the next keyframe plays (along with SEI if any).  When detaching
       from the encoder, the last detachment will fully stop the encoder and
       detach the encoder from the media output context associated with the
       encoder.
    
       SEI must actually be exported separately; because new encoder
       attachments may not always be at the beginning of the stream, the
       first keyframe they get must have that SEI data in it.  If the
       encoder has SEI data, it needs only add one small function to simply
       query that SEI data, and then that data will be handled automatically
       by libobs for all subsequent encoder attachments.
    
     - Implement x264 encoder plugin, move x264 files to separate plugin to
       separate necessary dependencies.
    
     - Change video/audio frame output structures to not use const
       qualifiers to prevent issues with non-const function usage elsewhere.
       This was an issue when writing the x264 encoder, as the x264 encoder
       expects non-const frame data.
    
       Change stagesurf_map to return a non-const data type to prevent this
       as well.
    
     - Change full range parameter of video scaler to be an enum rather than
       boolean

    Add preliminary streaming code for testing
    
     - Add some temporary streaming code using FFmpeg.  FFmpeg itself is not
       very ideal for streaming; lack of direct control of the sockets and
       no framedrop handling means that FFmpeg is definitely not something
       you want to use without wrapper code.  I'd prefer writing my own
       network framework in this particular case just because you give away
       so much control of the network interface.  Wasted an entire day
       trying to go through FFmpeg issues.
    
       There's just no way FFmpeg should be used for real streaming (at
       least without being patched or submitting some sort of patch, but I'm
       sort of feeling "meh" on that idea)
    
       I had to end up writing multiple threads just to handle both
       connecting and writing, because av_interleaved_write_frame blocks
       every call, stalling the main encoder thread, and thus also stalling
       draw signals.
    
     - Add some temporary user interface for streaming settings.  This is
       just temporary for the time being.  It's in the outputs section of
       the basic-mode settings
    
     - Make it so that dynamic arrays do not free all their data when the
       size just happens to be reduced to 0.  This prevents constant
       reallocation when an array keeps going from 1 item to 0 items.  Also,
       it was bad to become dependent upon that functionality.  You must now
       always explicitly call "free" on it to ensure the data is free, and
       that's how it should be.  Implicit functionality can lead to
       confusion and maintainability issues.

    Activate user-selected audio devices
    
     - Fix a bug where the initial audio data insertion would cause all
       audio data to unintentionally clear (mixed up < and > operators, damn
       human error)
    
     - Fixed a potential interdependant lock scenario with channel mutex
       locks and graphics mutex locks.  The main video thread could lock the
       graphics mutex and then while in the graphics mutex could lock the
       channels mutex.  Meanwhile in another thread, the channel mutex could
       get locked, and then the graphics mutex would get locked, causing a
       deadlock.
    
       The best way to deal with this is to not let mutexes lock within
       other mutexes, but sometimes it's difficult to avoid such as in the
       main video thread.
    
     - Audio devices should now be functional, and the devices in the audio
       settings can now be changed as desired.

    Use only one widget for preview
    
    Modify the obs_display API so that it always uses an orthographic
    projection that is the size of the display, rather than OBS' base size.
    Having it do an orthographic projection to OBS' base size was silly
    because it meant that everything would be skewed if you wanted to draw
    1:1 in the display.  This deoes mean that the callbacks must handle
    resizing the images, but it's worth it to ensure 1:1 draw sizes.
    
    As for the preview widget, instead of making some funky widget within
    widget that resizes, it's just going to be a widget within the entire
    top layout.  Also changed the preview padding color to gray.

       the ones that allocate to a different naming scheme to be safe

    Split output/input audio capture sources
    
     - Split input and output audio captures so that they're different
       sources.  This allows easier handling and enumeration of audio
       devices without having to do some sort of string processing.
    
       This way the user interface code can handle this a bit more easily,
       and so that it doesn't confuse users either.  This should be done for
       all audio capture sources for all operating systems.  You don't have
       to duplicate any code, you just need to create input/output wrapper
       functions to designate the audio as input or output before creation.
    
     - Make it detect soundflower and wavtap devices as mac "output" devices
       (even though they're actually input) for the mac output capture, and
       make it so that users can select a default output capture and
       automatically use soundflower or wavtap.
    
       I'm not entirely happy about having to do this, but because mac is
       designed this way, this is really the only way to handle it that
       makes it easier for users and UI code to deal with.
    
       Note that soundflower and wavtap are still also designated as input
       devices, so will still show up in input device enumeration.
    
     - Remove pragma messages because they were kind polluting the other
       compiler messages and just getting in the way.  In the future we can
       just do a grep for TODO to find them.
    
     - Redo list property again, this time using a safer internal array,
       rather than requiring sketchy array inputs.  Having functions handle
       everything behind the scenes is much safer.
    
     - Remove the reference counter debug log code, as it was included
       unintentionally in a commit.

    Remove categories from properties
    
    Categories added an unnecessary complexity to making properties, and
    would very likely almost never be used in most cases, and were more of a
    display feature.  The main issue is that it made property data more
    complex to work with, and I just didn't feel comfortable with that.
    
    Also, added a function to allow you to retrieve a porperty just by its
    name.

    Simplify and improve 'list' property
    
    When a source/output/etc has a property of a 'list' type, there was no
    way to get the names associated with its values.  That, and it only
    supported lists of either text, or enums (0..[value] only).
    
    Now, you can associate translated names with those values, and use
    integer, float, or string values.  Put it all in to one function as well
    to simplify its usage.
    
    I plan on using this to help get enumerations from devices/etc for
    certain types of sources.  For example, if I get the properties of an
    audio source, I'd like to have a list of available devices with it as
    well.

    Simplify and extend callback/signalling system
    
    - Signals and dynamic callbacks now require declarations to be made
      before being used.  What this does is allows us to get information
      about the functions dynamically which can be relayed to the user and
      plugins for future extended usage (this should have big implications
      later for scripting in particular, hopefully).
    
    - Reduced the number of types calldata uses from "everything I could
      think of" to simply integer, float, bool, pointer/object, string.
      Integer data is now stored as long long.  Floats are now stored as
      doubles (check em).
    
    - Use a more consistent naming scheme for lexer error/warning macros.
    
    - Fixed a rather nasty bug where switching to an existing scene would
      cause it to increment sourceSceneRefs, which would mean that it would
      never end up never properly removing the source when the user clicks
      removed (stayed in limbo, obs_source_remove never got called)

    CoreAudio: Detect default device change
    
    If the default device changes, set the reconnect interval to 200
    milliseconds so it pretty much immediately tries to reinitialize the
    audio with the newly selected default device.  Otherwise, use 2000
    millisecond intervals, and assume disconnection.
    
    Also, reduced FFmpeg logging to just regular FFmpeg information rather
    than everything FFmpeg logs.

    LOG_WARNING should be used in places where it's not entirely unexpected,

    being still.

    the 700ms audio buffering time, and audio data would get cut off.  Just
    increasing the buffering a little bit fixes the issue.

    lines for each audio source.  Very painful.

    Separate source activation for main/aux views
    
    Split off activate to activate and show callbacks, and split off
    deactivate to deactivate and hide callbacks.  Sources didn't previously
    have a means to know whether it was actually being displayed in the main
    view or just happened to be visible somewhere.  Now, for things like
    transition sources, they have a means of knowing when they have actually
    been "activated" so they can initiate their sequence.
    
    A source is now only considered "active" when it's being displayed by
    the main view.  When a source is shown in the main view, the activate
    callback/signal is triggered.  When it's no longer being displayed by
    the main view, deactivate callback/signal is triggered.
    
    When a source is just generally visible to see by any view, the show
    callback/signal is triggered.  If it's no longer visible by any views,
    then the hide callback/signal is triggered.
    
    Presentation volume will now only be active when a source is active in
    the main view rather than also in auxilary views.
    
    Also fix a potential bug where parents wouldn't properly increment or
    decrement all the activation references of a child source when a child
    was added or removed.

    Implement volume handling
    
     - Remove obs_source::type because it became redundant now that the
       type is always stored in the obs_source::info variable.
    
     - Apply presentation volumes of 1.0 and 0.0 to sources when they
       activate/deactivate, respectively.  It also applies that presentation
       volume to all sub-sources, with exception of transition sources.
       Transition sources must apply presentation volume manually to their
       sub-sources with the new transition functions below.
    
     - Add a "transition_volume" variable to obs_source structure, and add
       three functions for handling volume for transitions:
    
       * obs_transition_begin_frame
       * obs_source_set_transition_vol
       * obs_transition_end_frame
    
       Because the to/from targets of a transition source might both contain
       some of the same sources, handling the transitioning of volumes for
       that specific situation becomes an issue.
    
       So for transitions, instead of modifying the presentation volumes
       directly for both sets of sources, we do this:
    
       - First, call obs_transition_begin_frame at the beginning of each
         transition frame, which will reset transition volumes for all
         sub-sources to 0.  Presentation volumes remain unchanged.
    
       - Call obs_source_set_transition_vol on each sub-source, which will
         then add the volume to the transition volume for each source in
         that source's tree.  Presentation volumes still remain unchanged.
    
       - Then you call obs_trandition_end_frame when complete, which will
         then finally set the presentation volumes to the transition
         volumes.
    
       For example, let's say that there's one source that's within both the
       "transitioning from" sources and "transition to" sources.  It would
       add both the fade in and fade out volumes to that source, and then
       when the frame is complete, it would set the presentation volume to
       the sum of those two values, rather than set the presentation volume
       for that same source twice which would cause weird volume jittering
       and also set the wrong values.

    Add volume signals

    Implement source activation/deactivation
    
    Now sources will be properly activated and deactivated when they are in
    use or not in use.
    
    Had to figure out a way to handle child sources, and children of
    children, just ended up implementing simple functions that parents use
    to signal adding/removal to help with hierarchial activation and
    deactivation of child sources.
    
    To prevent the source activate/deactivate callbacks from being called
    more than once, added an activation reference counter.  The first
    increment will call the activate callback, and the last decrement will
    call the deactivate callback.
    
    Added "source-activate" and "source-deactivate" signals to the main obs
    signal handler, and "activate" and "deactivate" to individual source
    signal handlers.
    
    Also, fixed the main window so it properly selects a source when the
    current active scene has been changed.

    Added a "master" volume for the entire audio subsystem.
    
    Also, added a "presentation" volume for both the master volume and for
    each invidiaul source.  The presentation volume is used to control
    things like transitioning volumes, preventing sources from outputting
    any audio when they're inactive, as well as some other uses in the
    future.

    Properly clamp audio timing and remove warnings
    
    If audio was under, it originally did a full reset of the audio timing.
    However, resetting the audio timing when this happens is kind of a bad
    thing.  It's better just to clamp the value to the expected timestamp to
    ensure seamless audio output.
    
    Also, implement audio timestamp smoothing to ensure audio tries to be as
    seamless as possible.

    Fix precision issues with new conversion shader
    
    Turns out that on some adapters, due to some sort of internal GPU
    precision error, fmod(x, y) can return x when x == y, wich is incorrect
    (and no, they were actually equal, not off due to precision errors).
    
    This would cause the shader to sample wrong coordinates on the edges
    sometimes.  Just adding 0.1 to the x value before being put in to fmod
    and then flooring the result after fixes the issue.

    Make a number of key optimizations
    
     - Changed glMapBuffer to glMapBufferRange to allow invalidation.  Using
       just glMapBuffer alone was causing some unacceptable stalls.
    
     - Changed dynamic buffers from GL_DYNAMIC_WRITE to GL_STREAM_WRITE
       because I had misunderstood the OpenGL specification
    
     - Added _OPENGL and _D3D11 builtin preprocessor macros to effects to
       allow special processing if needed
    
     - Added fmod support to shaders (NOTE: D3D and GL do not function
       identically with negative numbers when using this.  Positive numbers
       however function identically)
    
     - Created a planar conversion shader that converts from packed YUV to
       planar 420 right on the GPU without any CPU processing.  Reduces
       required GPU download size to approximately 37.5% of its normal rate
       as well.  GPU usage down by 10 entire percentage points despite the
       extra required pass.

    Optimize GL staging surface and fix mac issue
    
    Staging surfaces with GL originally copied to a texture and then
    downloaded that copied texture, but I realized that there was really no
    real need to do that.  Now instead they'll copy directly from the
    texture that's given to them rather than copying to a buffer first.
    
    Secondly, hopefully fix the mac issue where the only way to perform an
    asynchronous texture download is via FBOs and glReadPixels.  It's a
    really dumb issue with macs and the amount of "gotchas" and non-standard
    internal GL functionaly on mac is really annoying.

    Revamp rendering system to allow custom rendering
    
    Originally, the rendering system was designed to only display sources
    and such, but I realized there would be a flaw; if you wanted to render
    the main viewport in a custom way, or maybe even the entire application
    as a graphics-based front end, you wouldn't have been able to do that.
    
    Displays have now been separated in to viewports and displays.  A
    viewport is used to store and draw sources, a display is used to handle
    draw callbacks.  You can even use displays without using viewports to
    draw custom render displays containing graphics calls if you wish, but
    usually they would be used in combination with source viewports at
    least.
    
    This requires a tiny bit more work to create simple source displays, but
    in the end its worth it for the added flexibility and options it brings.

    Revamp API and start using doxygen
    
    The API used to be designed in such a way to where it would expect
    exports for each individual source/output/encoder/etc.  You would export
    functions for each and it would automatically load those functions based
    on a specific naming scheme from the module.
    
    The idea behind this was that I wanted to limit the usage of structures
    in the API so only functions could be used.  It was an interesting idea
    in theory, but this idea turned out to be flawed in a number of ways:
    
     1.) Requiring exports to create sources/outputs/encoders/etc meant that
         you could not create them by any other means, which meant that
         things like faruton's .net plugin would become difficult.
    
     2.) Export function declarations could not be checked, therefore if you
         created a function with the wrong parameters and parameter types,
         the compiler wouldn't know how to check for that.
    
     3.) Required overly complex load functions in libobs just to handle it.
         It makes much more sense to just have a load function that you call
         manually.  Complexity is the bane of all good programs.
    
     4.) It required that you have functions of specific names, which looked
         and felt somewhat unsightly.
    
    So, to fix these issues, I replaced it with a more commonly used API
    scheme, seen commonly in places like kernels and typical C libraries
    with abstraction.  You simply create a structure that contains the
    callback definitions, and you pass it to a function to register that
    definition (such as obs_register_source), which you call in the
    obs_module_load of the module.
    
    It will also automatically check the structure size and ensure that it
    only loads the required values if the structure happened to add new
    values in an API change.
    
    The "main" source file for each module must include obs-module.h, and
    must use OBS_DECLARE_MODULE() within that source file.
    
    Also, started writing some doxygen documentation in to the main library
    headers.  Will add more detailed documentation as I go.

    Implement output, improve video/audio subsystems
    
     - Fill in the rest of the FFmpeg test output code for testing so it
       actually properly outputs data.
    
     - Improve the main video subsystem to be a bit more optimal and
       automatically output I420 or NV12 if needed.
    
     - Fix audio subsystem insertation and byte calculation.  Now it will
       seamlessly insert new audio data in to the audio stream based upon
       its timestamp value.  (Be extremely cautious when using floating
       point calculations for important things like this, and always round
       your values and check your values)
    
     - Use 32 byte alignment in case of future optimizations and export a
       function to get the current alignment.
    
     - Make os_sleepto_ns return true if slept, false if the time has
       already been passed before the call.
    
     - Fix sinewave output so that it actually properly calculates a middle
       C sinewave.
    
     - Change the use of row_bytes to linesize (also makes it a bit more
       consistent with FFmpeg's naming as well)

    Add planar audio support, improve test output
    
    - Add planar audio support.  FFmpeg and libav use planar audio for many
      encoders, so it was somewhat necessary to add support in libobs
      itself.
    
    - Improve/adjust FFmpeg test output plugin.  The exports were somewhat
      messed up (making me rethink how exports should be done).  Not yet
      functional; it handles video properly, but it still does not handle
      audio properly.
    
    - Improve planar video code.  The planar video code was not properly
      accounting for row sizes for each plane.  Specifying row sizes for
      each plane has now been added.  This will also make it more compatible
      with FFmpeg/libav.
    
    - Fixed a bug where callbacks wouldn't create properly in audio-io and
      video-io code.
    
    - Implement 'blogva' function to allow for va_list usage with libobs
      logging.

    3) Fixed a retarded bug in IsVersionGEQ.
    4) Slapped myself for not seeing IsVersionGEQ bug earlier. Most important change.

    Implement output scaling/conversion/downloading
    
    - Implement texture scaling/conversion/downloading for the main view so
      we can finally start getting data to output.
    
      Also, redesign how it works a bit, it will now properly wait one full
      frame for each step in the process:  rendering the main texture,
      scaling the main texture to an output texture, staging/downloading the
      ouput texture, and then outputting that staged data.  This way, the
      GPU will have more than enough time to fully complete each step.
    
    - Fix a bug with OpenGL plugin's texture staging function.  Was using
      glBindBuffer instead of what should have been used:  glBindTexture.
    
    - Change the naming scheme of the variables in default.effect.  It's now
      named with the idea of just "color matrix" in mind instead of "yuv
      matrix", and instead of DrawRGBToYUV, it's now just DrawMatrix.

    Improve thread safety in UI code
    
    - Implemented better C++ classes for handling scenes/sources/items in
      obs.hpp, allowing them to automatically increment and decrement the
      references of each, as well as assign them to QVariants.
    
    - Because QVariants are now using the C++ classes, remove the pointer
      QVariant wrapper.
    
    - Use the new C++ classes with the QVariant user data of list box items,
      both for the sake of thread safety and to ensure that the data
      referenced is not freed until removed.  NOTE: still might need some
      testing.
    
    - Implemented a source-remove signal from libobs, and start using that
      signal instead of the source-destroy signal for signalling item
      removal.

    - Change some of the property API names.  obs_property_list_t felt a bit
      awkward when actually using it, so I just renamed it to
      obs_properties_t.
    
    - Removed the getdata/setdata nad getparam/setparam functions from
      sources/services, they will be superseded by the dynamic procedure
      call API.

    Implement properties definition interface
    
    Implement a properties definition interface to allow modules to export
    general properties associated with objects of libobs.
    
    The properties definition interface allows the option for automatic
    settings UI generation (which will make simple plugins easier to develop
    without the need for user interface), as well as allow real-time
    property editing of values of things like sources/outputs/etc without
    having to open property dialogs.  More property types can be added in
    the future as needed as well.

    Simplify/improve UI exporting a bit more
    
    Reduce and simplify the UI export interface.  Having to export functions
    with designated names was a bit silly for this case, it makes more sense
    for inputs/outputs/etc because they have more functions associated with
    them, but in this case the callback can be retrieved simply through the
    enumeration exports.  Makes it a bit easier and a little less awkward
    for this situation.
    
    Also, changed the exports and names to be a bit more consistent,
    labelling them both as either "modal" or "modeless", and changed the UI
    function calls to obs_exec_ui and obs_create_ui to imply modal/modeless
    functionality a bit more.

    Don't rely on static data
    
    The ui_enum function gets a const struct obs_ui_info **, which basically
    means it expects static data to be used.  I originally had it the other
    way around, but yea, it's probably not a good idea, so I'm going to
    revert back to the original code instead, which doesn't rely on the data
    being static.

    Add module UI export capability
    
    Add the ability to be able to call and use toolkit-specific or
    program-specific user interface in modules.
    
    User interface code can be either bundled with the module, or 'split'
    out in to separate libraries (recommended).
    
    There are three reasons why splitting is recommended:
    
      1.) It allows plugins to be able to create custom user interface for
          each toolkit if desired.
    
      2.) Often, UI will be programmed in one language (the language of the
          toolkit), and core logic may be programmed in another.  This
          allows plugins to keep the languages separated if necessary.
    
      3.) It prevents direct linkage of UI toolkits libraries with core
          module logic.
    
    Splitting is not required, though is recommended if you want your plugin
    to be more flexible with other user interface toolkits or programs.
    
    Will implement a generic properties lookup next, which will be used for
    automatic UI handling so that plugin UI isn't necessarily required.

    Improve thread safety for scene items
    
    Scene items previously were removed by calling obs_sceneitem_destroy,
    but this proved to be a potential race condition where two different
    threads could try to destroy the same scene item at the same time.
    
    Instead of doing that, reference counting is now used on scene items,
    and an explicit obs_sceneitem_remove function is used instead for item
    removal, which sets a 'removed' variable to ensure it can only be called
    exactly one time.

    Fix the design flaw with obs_sceneitem_destroy
    
    The previous commit used the scene as a  parameter to check to see if
    the scene item was still present within the scene before destroying, but
    this was actually unnecessary because the fault was because the destroy
    signal was being triggered *before* the scene's mutex locked, thus
    causing a race condition.  I changed the code so that it signals after
    the lock instead of before, so the scene parameter should no longer be
    necessary.

    Improve setting type consistency

commit 9116be8d9c562c9d62931e4c664af6f79fd44404
Author: jp9000 <obs.jim@gmail.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 28 18:41:24 2014 -0700

    Improve safety for settings usage
    
    - Add 'set_default' functions to obs-data.*.  These functions ensure
      that a paramter exists and that the parameter is of a specific type.
      If not, it will create or overwrite the value with the default setting
      instead.
    
      These functions are meant to be explicitly called before using any of
      the 'get' functions.  The reason why it was designed this way is to
      encourage defaults to be set in a single place/function.
    
      For example, ideal usage is to create one function for your data,
      "set_my_defaults(obs_data_t data)", set all the default values within
      that function, and then call that function on create/update, that way
      all defaults are centralized to a single place.
    
    - Ensure that data passed to sources/encoders/outputs/etc is always
      valid, and not a null value.
    
    - While I'm remembering, fix a few defaults of the main program config
      file data.

Date:   Tue Jan 28 15:45:30 2014 -0700

    Add a couple more setting data safety measures
    
    Prevent null dereferencing if data is null, instead just make the
    functions return and ignore the get/set requests.

    Implement settings interface for plugins
    
    Add a fairly easy to use settings interface that can be passed to
    plugins, and replaced the old character string system that was being
    used before.  The new data interface allows for an easier method of
    getting/altering settings for plugins, and is built to be serializable
    to/from JSON.
    
    Also, removed another wxFormBuilder file that was no longer in use.

    Finish the rest of the settings dialog code
    
    - Move over the last of the original settings dialog code to QT.  It was
      actually a bit easier to write in the QT version.  wxWidgets was

    Apply a number of fixes to the main window
    
    - Fix the size issue with list boxes on mac.  Was displaying the list
      boxes with an improper size.  Turns out it was just the wrong size
      policies on the frame below.
    
    - Ensure the main windows are fully displayed *before* initializing
      subsystems.  This ensures that the graphics system will properly start
      up on macos, and allows the glitch fix.
    
    - Made a workaround for weird QT glitch that would happen to the parent
      of a pure native widget that also has internal painting fully
      disabled.  (Should definitely write an example and report this bug on
      the QT forums)

    Fix a few formatting issues
    
    Fixed a few files that went over 80 columns, mostly just a nitpack on my
    part.
    
    libobs/obs-nix.c had a rather bad case of leading whitespace.
    
    Also, fixed the x86 obs-studio project files so that it would properly
    output to the right directory.  It couldn't find libobs.lib because
    obs-studio's project settings had it outputting to a different place
    than the rest of the projects.

    Fix render issues with main preview widget
    
     - I seem to have fixed ths issues with the main preview widget.  It
       seems you just need to set the right window attributes to stop it from
       breaking.  Though when opengl is enabled, there appears to be a weird
       background glitch in the Qt stuff -- I'm not entirely sure what's
       going on.  Bug in Qt?
    
       Also fixed the layout issues, and the widget now properly resizes and
       centers in to its parent widget.
    
     - Prevent the render loop from accessing data if the data isn't valid.
       Because obs->data is freed before the graphics stuff, it can cause
       the graphics to keep trying to query the obs->data.displays_mutex
       after it had already been destroyed.

    Change the UI to Qt (work in progress)
    
    --------------------------------------------------
    Notes and details
    --------------------------------------------------
    Why was this done?  Because wxWidgets was just lacking in many areas.  I
    know wxWidgets is designed to be used with native controls, and that's
    great, but wxWidgets just is not a feature-complete toolkit for
    multiplatform applications.  It lacks in dialog editors, its code is
    archaic and outdated, and I just feel frustrated every time I try to do
    things with it.
    
    Qt on the other hand..  I had to actually try Qt to realize how much
    better it was as a toolkit.  They've got everything from dialog editors,
    to an IDE, a debugger, build tools, just everything, and it's all
    top-notch and highly maintained.  The focus of the toolkit is
    application development, and they spend their time trying to help
    people do exactly that:  make programs.  Great support, great tools,
    and because of that, great toolkit.  I just didn't want to alienate any
    developers by being stubborn about native widgets.
    
    There *are* some things that are rather lackluster about it and design
    choices I disagree with though.  For example, I realize that to have an
    easy to use toolkit you have to have some level of code generation.
    However, in my personal and humble opinion, moc just feels like a
    terrible way to approach the problem.  Even now I feel like there are a
    variety of ways you could handle code generation and automatic
    management of things like that.  I don't like the idea of circumventing
    the language itself like that.  It feels like one giant massive hack.
    
    --------------------------------------------------
    Things that aren't working properly:
    --------------------------------------------------
     - Settings dialog is not implemented.  The dialog is complete but the
       code to handle the dialog hasn't been constructed yet.
    
     - There is a problem with using Qt widgets as a device target on
       windows, with at least OpenGL: if I have the preview widget
       automatically resize itself, it seems to cause some sort of video
       card failure that I don't understand.
    
     - Because of the above, resizing the preview widget has been disabled
       until I can figure out what's going on, so it's currently only a
       32x32 area.
    
     - Direct3D doesn't seem to render correctly either, seems that the
       viewport is messed up or something.  I'm sort of confused about
       what's going on with it.
    
     - The new main window seems to be triggering more race conditions than
       the wxWidgets main window dialog did.  I'm not entirely sure what's
       going on here, but this may just be existing race conditions within
       libobs itself that I just never spotted before (even though I tend to
       be very thorough with race conditions any time I use variables
       cross-thread)

    Add preliminary ffmpeg plugin (still testing)
    
    - Added some code for FFmpeg output that I'm still playing around with.
      Right now I'm just trying to get it to output to file and try to
      understand the FFmpeg/libav APIs.  Hopefully in the future this plugin
      can be used for any sort of output to FFmpeg.
    
    - Fixed a cast warning in audio-io.c with size_t -> uint32_t
    
    - Renamed the 'video_info' and 'audio_info' structures to
      'video_conver_info' and 'audio_convert_info' to better represent their
      actual purpose, and to avoid confusion with 'audio_output_info' and
      'video_output_info' structures.
    
    - Removed a few macros from obs-def.h that were at one point going to be
      used but no longer going to be used (at least for now)

    Use macros to improve safety loading callbacks
    
    Just a minor fix mostly because I noticed that I kept accidentally
    forgetting to add checks to the code properly.  This is one of those
    cases where macros come in useful, as macros can automate the process
    and help prevent these mistakes from happening by accident.

    Add preliminary output/encoder interface
    
    - First, I redid the output interface for libobs.  I feel like it's
      going in a pretty good direction in terms of design.
    
      Right now, the design is so that outputs and encoders are separate.
      One or more outputs can connect to a specific encoder to receive its
      data, or the output can connect directly to raw data from libobs
      output itself, if the output doesn't want to use a designated encoder.
      Data is received via callbacks set when you connect to the encoder or
      raw output.  Multiple outputs can receive the data from a single
      encoder context if need be (such as for streaming to multiple channels
      at once, and/or recording with the same data).
    
      When an encoder is first connected to, it will connect to raw output,
      and start encoding.  Additional connections will receive that same
      data being encoded as well after that.  When the last encoder has
      disconnected, it will stop encoding.  If for some reason the encoder
      needs to stop, it will use the callback with NULL to signal that
      encoding has stopped.  Some of these things may be subject to change
      in the future, though it feels pretty good with this design so far.
      Will have to see how well it works out in practice versus theory.
    
    - Second, Started adding preliminary RTMP/x264 output plugin code.
    
      To speed things up, I might just make a direct raw->FFmpeg output to
      create a quick output plugin that we can start using for testing all
      the subsystems.

    Simplify media i/o interfaces
    
    Completely revamped the entire media i/o data and handlers.  The
    original idea was to have a system that would have connecting media
    inputs and outputs, but at a certain point I realized that this was an
    unnecessary complexity for what we wanted to do.  (Also, it reminded me
    of directshow filters, and I HATE directshow with a passion, and
    wouldn't wish it upon my greatest enemy)
    
    Now, audio/video outputs are connected to directly, with better callback
    handlers, and will eventually have the ability to automatically handle
    conversions such as 4:4:4 to 4:2:0 when connecting to an input that uses
    them.  Doing this will allow the video/audio i/o handlers to also
    prevent duplicate conversion, as well as make it easier/simple to use.
    
    My true goal for this is to make output and encoder plugins as simple to
    create as possible.  I want to be able to be able to create an output
    plugin with almost no real hassle of having to worry about image
    conversions, media inputs/outputs, etc.  A plugin developer shouldn't
    have to handle that sort of stuff when he/she doesn't really need to.
    
    Plugins will be able to simply create a callback via obs_video() and/or
    obs_audio(), and they will automatically receive the audio/video data in
    the formats requested via a simple callback, without needing to do
    almost anything else at all.

    Fix one minor bug with new timing code
    
    When the first async video frame is used it would not set audio timing,
    moved that code into obs_source_getframe.  Also, might consider renaming
    obs_source_getframe.  "Query frame" instead perhaps?  Will sleep on it,
    might not even bother.

    Add preliminary handling of timestamp invalidation
    
    - Add preliminary (yet to be tested) handling of timestamp invalidation
      issues that can happen with specific devices, where timestamps can
      reset or go backward/forward in time with no rhyme or reason.  Spent
      the entire day just trying to figure out the best way to handle this.
    
      If both audio and video are present, it will increment a reference
      counter if video timestamps invalidate, and decrement the reference
      counter when the audio timestamps invalidate.  When the reference
      counter is not 0, it will not send audio as the audio will have
      invalid timing.  What this does is it ensures audio data will never go
      out of bounds in relation to the video, and waits for both audio and
      video timestamps to "jump" together before resuming audio.
    
    - Moved async video frame timing adjustment code into
      obs_source_getframe instead so it's automatically handled whenever
      called.
    
    - Removed the 'audio wait buffer' as it was an unnecessary complexity
      that could have had problems in the future.  Instead, audio will not
      be added until video starts for sources that have both async
      audio/video.  Audio could have buffered for too long of a time anyway,
      who knows what devices are going to do.
    
    - Fixed a minor conversion warning in audio-io.c

    Account for thread pauses for audio data
    
     - In the audio I/O code, if there's a pause in the program or its
       threads (especially the audio thread), it'll cause it to sample too
       much data, and increase line->base_timestamp to a potentially higher
       value than the next audio timestamp that may be added to the line.
       This would cause it to crash originally, because it expects audio
       data that is within the designated buffering limit.
    
       Because that audio data cannot be filled by that data anyway, just
       ignore the audio data until it goes back to the right timing (which
       it will as long as the code that is using the line accounts for its
       current system time)

    Detect audio timestamp jumps and reset timing
    
     - Often, timestamps will go "back" in time with certain..  terrible
       devices that no one should use.  When this occurs, timing is now
       reset so that the new audio comes in directly after the old audio
       seamlessly.

    Added a sinewave audio test source
    
     - Added a test audio sinewave test source that should just play a sine
       wave of the middle C note.  Using unsigned 8 bit mono to test
       ffmpeg's audio resampler, seems to work pretty good.
    
     - Fixed a boolean trap in threading.h for the event_init function, it
       now uses enum event_type, which can be EVENT_TYPE_MANUAL or
       EVENT_TYPE_AUTO, to specify whether the event is automatically reset
       or not.
    
     - Changed display names of test sources to something a little less
       vague.
    
     - Removed te whole "if timestamp is 0 just use current system time"
       when outputting source audio, if you want to use system time you
       should just use system time yourself.  Using 0 as some sort of
       "indicator" like that just makes things confusing, and prevents you
       from legitimately using 0 as a timestamp for your audio data.

    A few changes concerning wxGTK.
    
    For one, I added a new member gs_window for future use.
    The member is "display" which represents our connection to X11.
    Ideally, we should use this specific connection to deal with our Window.
    For now, it's disabled. Read comment for more information.
    
    Secondly, wxGTK apparently doesn't map our window in some cases.
    This causes the window ID passed to be bad and will stop (or segfault)
    our program. This might be related to the first commit above.
    
    For now, all this commit does is realize the window manually.

    Use recursive mutex for user sources and displays
    
     - Using a recursive mutex fixes issues where objects need to enter the
       main libobs sources mutex while already within the mutex in the same
       thread.  Otherwise it would keep getting locked on itself on
       destruction.

       for multiplying the volume with all the different audio bit depths.
       (Could probably be greatly optmimized later)

    Handle source adding/removal better
    
     - Made it so that when a source is added or removed from a scene it
       will add a reference to sourceSceneRefs (std::unordered_map).  Each
       source adds a reference to that every time they are added to a scene,
       and releases a reference from it when they are removed from a scene.
    
       When the value reaches 0, the source is no longer in any scenes, and
       is then marked for removal and destroyed.
    
       Before, I was using the source internal reference counter, which is a
       really bad thing to do because I don't know what might actually be
       referencing it.  So using a separate discrete reference counter for
       the number of scenes it's in is better in this case.

    Fixed debug extension check
    
     - Check the actual debug extension instead of checking GL 4.0 support;
       it appears that despite having GL 4.0 support, AMD does not implement
       the standard debug extensions even when the *_CONTEXT_DEBUG_BIT_ARB
       flag is set on the context.
    
     - Also, fixed a place where spaces where used for indents instead of a
       tab.

    Fixed debug GL functions on windows (amend)
    
     - Removed the dependency on windows.h for windows.  I feel it's an
       unnecessarily large dependency to have to add to all source files
       when the only thing that's needed to make the windows version compile
       the debug functions is just the __stdcall call convention keyword.
    
       On top of increasing compile time due to the large number of headers
       it includes from all the windows API headers, it also adds a lot of
       potential name conflicts, as I was getting a number of name conflicts
       for lots of names like near/far, which were used in old legacy 16bit
       windows code.

    enters video_output_wait (the thread calling obs_free_video would
    block on pthread_join and obs_video_thread would block on

    Remove from list based upon data, not string
    
     - Added an extra comment regarding source removal
    
     - Made is so that when a scene item is removed from the sources list
       box, it removes the item based upon the GetClientData rather than by
       its string name.  This is done because there may be duplicate sources
       in a particular scene, and it's important to remove the right one.

     - Changed AddSourcePopup to AddSourcePopupMenu.  Name actually confused
       me once despite being the writer, so it was clearly a bad name.

      Sources can now be added to scenes via user interface.  It's a little
    convoluted because everything has to work through OBS signals to ensure
    that plugins/etc can modify the scenes/sources exernally.
    
      Also, when switching scenes, it will properly list sources for the
    scene you changed to.

    Added some return-style functions to calldata.h
    
      When using signal callbacks, there is rarely a need to check to see if
    the callback paramters are actually validl; in those cases, if they are
    invalid, then the signal is being used incorrectly.  The calldata_get*
    functions are meant to be used more for when using dynamic function
    calls rather than when using signals.  The calldata_get* functions made
    it so that you have to declare your varaibles, and then call that
    function to assign that value to those variables, which was slightly
    annoying to constantly have to do over and over.
    
      Therefore I created a few extra functions for returning the value
    without having to check for validity.  Although you would think this
    would be an issue for maintaining, keep in mind that these functions
    return base types.  Admittedly, these functions are merely for
    convenience.

    Fixes issues with autoconf
    
    In particular, it removes any deprecated functionality
    wxWidgets only documents their deprecated m4 macros and gives a poor example
    Also to note in regard to wxWidgets, I removed any unneeded libraries from the linker line.
    
    Any warning messages provided by autoconf has been supressed in the most appropriate manner possible.
